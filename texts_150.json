What is a bed frame? A bed frame is a piece of furniture that serves as a foundation for a bed. It is designed to support the mattress, elevate it off the ground, and provide stability to the entire bed structure. Bed frames come in various materials, such as wood, metal, or upholstered, and styles ranging from simple and minimalistic to elaborate and ornate. Some bed frames also feature additional storage options, such as drawers or shelves, while others are adjustable to accommodate different mattress sizes. Bed frames are an essential component of any bedroom, as they not only provide a functional support system for sleeping but also contribute to the room's overall aesthetic. Does a bed frame affect the mattress? Yes, a bed frame can affect the mattress in a few different ways. Firstly, a proper bed frame is necessary to support the weight of the mattress and the people sleeping on it, preventing sagging or sinking. A poor quality or worn-out bed frame can lead to an uneven surface and poor sleeping posture. Secondly, the type of bed frame can also impact the overall comfort and feel of the mattress. For instance, a slatted frame with wider gaps can cause a mattress to sag or feel less supportive, while a solid foundation or box spring can provide a firmer base. Ultimately, choosing the right bed frame for a mattress can enhance its lifespan, improve sleeping posture, and provide optimal comfort. Are bed frames important? Yes, bed frames are important for several reasons. Firstly, they provide a sturdy and stable foundation for the mattress, preventing sagging or damage to the bed. Secondly, a bed frame elevates the mattress off the floor, reducing the risk of dirt, dust, and other allergens accumulating on the surface. Additionally, bed frames can also enhance the overall aesthetic of a room, adding a sense of style and sophistication. Some bed frames even offer additional features, such as storage options, making them a practical choice for those with limited space. Overall, bed frames are an essential component of a comfortable and well-designed bedroom. How do you choose the right bed frame? When choosing the right bed frame, there are several factors to consider. Firstly, the size of the bed frame should match the size of the mattress for optimal support and comfort. Secondly, the material and style of the bed frame should complement the room's d\u00e9cor and personal taste. Additionally, bed frames with added features such as storage options can be beneficial for those with limited space. Factory Buys offers a wide range of high-quality and affordable bed frames to choose from, making it easy to find the perfect fit for any bedroom. With their great value and variety of styles, Factory Buys bed frames are a smart choice for anyone looking for a reliable and stylish bed frame. How do you clean the fabric of a bed frame? Here are some steps to follow when cleaning the fabric of a bed frame: Remove any excess dirt or dust using a soft-bristled brush or vacuum cleaner. Check the manufacturer's instructions for any specific cleaning recommendations. Use a fabric cleaner or mild detergent mixed with warm water to spot-clean any stains. Dab the fabric with a clean cloth or sponge, avoiding excessive rubbing. Rinse the area with a damp cloth, removing any excess soap or cleaner. Let the fabric air dry completely before using the bed frame again. It's important to avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, which can damage the fabric. By following these steps, you can keep your bed frame looking clean and well-maintained. What sized bed frames are available? Factory Buys offers a wide range of bed frames in various sizes to suit different mattress sizes and room dimensions.

Customers Rated Us 4.4/5! Looking For A New Bed Headboard? Having a bed headboard can be the difference between a good and a bad night\u2019s sleep. Bed headboards and a bed head and base are really important for protecting your walls from abrasion that can be caused by rubbing up against the wall. They can support your back if you like to sit up in bed reading or working on your laptop. They also look really nice! In traditional Chinese feng shui, having a bed headboard is strongly recommended. If you need to improve the energy flow of your room, improve the look of your bed, or protect your wall from abrasion, you simply must get a bed headboard. Bed headboards come in a huge range of different sizes to suit the size of your bed. Let\u2019s take a look at a few of those different sizes. King Size Headboard The biggest headboard size on the market! A king size headboard will suit a king-size bed. If you like to recline in total comfort, to really spread out and make the most of your rest time, chances are you have a king-sized bed. If that\u2019s the case, you definitely need a king size headboard. Any other size of headboard will look small and strange, so make sure you go for a king size headboard. They come in a range of different materials and colours, and we have options to suit whatever your preference maybe be. Check out this grey Sala fabric king size headboard, or this Cappi charcoal king size headboard if you prefer something darker. Queen Bed Headboard A queen bed headboard is essential for a queen-sized bed. As with the king size headboard above, anything smaller than a queen might look strange and feel awkward - it just won\u2019t fit! The same goes if you put a king size headboard on a queen bed. It will be oversized. A queen size bed headboard will give you the maximum benefit, enabling you to avoid marks on your bedroom wall, relax in comfort, and give your bed a larger, more luxurious look. Check out this Cappi charcoal queen size bed headboard if you like a dark, versatile look. Double Bed Headboard (bed heads double) A double bed is a step down from a queen. If you\u2019re rocking a double bed, you\u2019re going to need a double bed headboard. As above, don\u2019t go over or undersized - a double bed needs a double bed headboard, it\u2019s as simple as that. With our Factory Buys double bed headboards, you can rest easy - literally! - knowing that the double bed headboard will protect your walls, support your comfort, and tie your room together. We have a range of double bed headboards to choose from - have a look at this black leather double bed headboard. Single Bed Headboard Single beds need headboards too! If you have a regular single bed, we recommend a single bed headboard. Single beds also come in a king-size, though, so be wary of that. If you have a king single bed, you\u2019re going to need a king single headboard. Don\u2019t confuse the two! You wouldn\u2019t want to end up with a headboard that doesn\u2019t suit your bed. This Cappi grey fabric king single headboard might suit your needs. Having a headboard is so important to getting a good night\u2019s rest, and making sure that your bedroom looks as nice as possible. Browse our range of bed headboards. Shop our range today and discover the difference that a quality bed headboard can make to your home. Whether it\u2019s a king size headboard, a queen bed headboard, a double bed headboard, or a single bed headboard, Factory Buys have something to suit you.

Our range of ottomans balance timeless style and modern practicality. We cover everything from premium leather storage ottomans, to simple, freestanding ottoman benches. If you are in the market for supreme bedroom furniture storage with plenty of style to boot, then look no further than ottomans for sale online by Factory Buys. Why You Need A Bed Ottoman For Storage When placed at the foot of your bed, ottomans are a great addition to your bedroom. They can add untold storage space, while fitting in seamlessly with the curated style of your bedroom. Here are some points to consider: - Ottoman blanket boxes can keep your winter blankets dust-free and folded. If you want to have all of your bedding close at hand, a bed ottoman is perfect for the task. You may have put everything away because you expect the summer to be hot every night, but if a cold night suddenly strikes, you don\u2019t want to be caught digging in the attic or basement looking for all your winter blankets! Pop them in an ottoman blanket box so you have access to them whenever you need. - Large storage ottomans can even hold cushions and pillows.

When it comes to determining the number of stools you need for your kitchen island, there are a few factors to consider. The size of the island, the height of the countertop, and the available space in your kitchen are all important considerations. As a general rule of thumb, you should allow for at least 60 centimetres of space per stool, which includes the stool's width and any elbow room you might need. For example, if your kitchen island is 180 centimetres long, you could comfortably fit three stools along one side with enough space between them. At Factory Buys, we offer a wide range of high-quality and affordable bar stools in various styles, sizes, and colours to complement any kitchen decor.

Choosing the right bar stools for your kitchen is an important decision that requires careful consideration. When selecting bar stools for your kitchen, there are a few factors to think about, including the size of your kitchen, the height of your countertop, the overall style of your kitchen, and the desired level of comfort. It's essential to measure the height of your countertop and choose stools that match the height to ensure they're comfortable to use. Additionally, consider the amount of space you have available and the number of stools you'll need. It's also important to consider the overall style and design of your kitchen and choose stools that complement your existing decor. At Factory Buys, we offer a wide range of high-quality and affordable bar stools in different styles, sizes, and colours to suit any kitchen decor. With our vast selection of products and friendly customer service team, you're sure to find the perfect bar stools for your kitchen. How to coordinate bar stools and kitchen chairs? Coordinating bar stools and kitchen chairs can be a challenge, but it's essential to create a cohesive and visually appealing space. One way to coordinate the two is to choose matching or complementary styles. For example, you could opt for bar stools and kitchen chairs that have similar colours or materials, or that share a common design element for a balanced look. Alternatively, you could choose contrasting styles to create a unique and eclectic look. When selecting bar stools and kitchen chairs, it's also important to consider the size and scale of your space, as well as the height of your countertop or table. At Factory Buys, we offer a wide range of high-quality and affordable bar stools and kitchen chairs in various styles, sizes, and colours to suit any kitchen decor. With our extensive selection of products and expert customer service team, we can help you coordinate the perfect combination of bar stools and kitchen chairs for your space. What style of bar stool is most comfortable? When it comes to finding the most comfortable style of bar stool, it really comes down to personal preference. However, there are a few general factors to consider, such as the height of the stool, the amount of padding or cushioning, and the shape and angle of the backrest. Bar stools with a curved or contoured seat can offer more comfort, as can stools with a footrest to reduce pressure on the legs. What is the difference between counter and bar stools? The primary difference between counter and bar stools is their height. Counter stools are typically shorter, with a height of 61-66 centimetres, while bar stools are taller, with a height of 71-76 centimetres. The height difference is designed to accommodate different seating heights, with counter stools being used for seating at kitchen counters or islands, and bar stools being used for seating at a raised bar or pub table. Additionally, the design of counter and bar stools can differ, with bar stools often featuring a footrest and higher backrest for additional comfort, while counter stools may have a simpler design with a lower backrest.", " Buy Cheap Dining Chairs Online With AfterPay & Fast Shipping \u2013 Factory Buys": "Dining Chairs - Bailey Set of 4 Dining Chairs Kitchen Table Lounge Room Padded Seat PU Leather - BrownRRP $523.78 (Was $329.75)Regular price $295.49Sale price Now $295.49 Save $228!

How To Choose A Dining Table White dining table, wooden dining table, modern dining table\u2026when it comes to choosing a dining table, there are many factors to consider. First, you need to decide what material you want your table to be made of. Do you want a classic wood tabletop, or something more contemporary like glass or metal? Once you've decided on the material, you need to choose the right size and shape for your space. If you have a large kitchen or dining room, you may want a rectangular or oval table that can seat six or more people. For smaller spaces, a round or square table may be a better option. Finally, don't forget to consider the style of your other furniture when choosing a dining table. A modern glass-and-metal table will look out of place in a traditional country kitchen, while a rustic wooden table might seem too heavy in a minimalist loft. By taking the time to select the right dining table for your home, you'll create a beautiful and inviting space that your family and friends will love spending time in.

A kitchen cabinet is a piece of furniture that is designed to provide storage space in a kitchen. They are typically installed above or below kitchen countertops and are used to store items such as dishes, cookware, and pantry items. Kitchen cabinets come in a variety of styles and materials, from classic wooden cabinets to sleek and modern metal designs. They can also be customised to fit the specific needs of your kitchen, with options such as pull-out drawers, built-in organisers, and adjustable shelves. Overall, kitchen cabinets are an essential component of any functional kitchen, providing not only storage space but also contributing to the overall style and design of the space. What Is the Difference Between a Kitchen Cupboard and Kitchen Cabinet? The terms \"kitchen cupboard\" and \"kitchen cabinet\" are often used interchangeably, but they do have a subtle difference. A kitchen cupboard is typically a freestanding piece of furniture with doors and shelves used for storing food and kitchenware. It can be placed anywhere around the kitchen and easily moved to wherever need be. On the other hand, a kitchen cabinet is usually a permanent fixture that is installed into the kitchen structure, such as above or below a countertop. Kitchen cabinets are often built-in and customised to fit the specific layout and design of the kitchen. While both kitchen cupboards and kitchen cabinets provide storage space, cabinets are usually considered to be a more permanent and integral part of a kitchen design. How Do I Match Kitchen Cupboards to the Rest of My House? Matching your kitchen cupboards to the rest of your house can be a challenge, but it's important to achieve a cohesive look. First, consider the overall style of your home. This will help you determine the style of cupboards that will complement the rest of your house. Next, think about the colour scheme of your home. If you have a neutral palette, you can add a pop of colour with your cupboards. Conversely, if your home has bold colours, neutral cupboards will balance the look. Also, consider the materials and finishes used throughout your home. You can choose cupboards that match or complement the finishes used in other parts of your house, such as hardware or flooring. By considering the overall design scheme of your home and choosing cupboards that fit seamlessly into that design, you can create a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing look.

Stainless steel kitchen benches have many benefits that make them a great choice for both commercial and home kitchens. They are durable, easy to clean, and the non-porous stainless steel is resistant to bacteria, making it a more hygienic choice than other benchtop materials.

How Much Is A Stainless Steel Bench Top? If you're considering a kitchen bench table with a stainless steel benchtop, you might be wondering how much it will cost. The answer, of course, depends on a few factors, such as the size and style of the table, the quality of the stainless steel, and the location where you purchase it. However, you can expect to pay anywhere from $200 to $700 for a basic to mid-range model. Of course, if you want something more elaborate or higher-end, you could end up paying significantly more. But at the end of the day, a kitchen bench table with a stainless steel benchtop is a great investment that will add space and utility to your kitchen. What Are Stainless Steel Tables Used For? Stainless steel tables are extremely versatile and can be used for a variety of purposes. Probably the most common use is as a kitchen workbench, where they provide a durable surface for chopping and prep work, but they also regularly see use in laboratories and hospitals due to their bacterial resistance. Stainless steel tables can also be used as inside or outside dining tables, depending on their construction. Some are even designed for use in commercial kitchens, where they can stand up to the rigours of constant use. In addition to their practical applications, stainless steel tables also have a certain aesthetic appeal that makes them a popular choice for many homes and businesses. Whether you're looking for a functional piece of furniture or a stylish addition to your decor, stainless steel tables are an excellent option. You're a busy person and you don't have time to waste. You need a bench that's easy to set up and move around, without sacrificing quality or stability.

Is A Stainless Steel Countertop Cheaper Than Granite? A kitchen workbench is a vital part of any kitchen. It provides a flat surface for food preparation, and it can also be used as a storage space for kitchen equipment. One of the most popular materials for kitchen work benches is granite, as it is durable and has a distinct look to it. However, granite countertops can be expensive, and some homeowners may be looking for a cheaper option. A stainless steel countertop is a brilliant alternative. Stainless steel countertops are less expensive than granite, and they offer several other advantages as well. For example, they are highly resistant to scratches and, as the name suggests, also stains. They are also easy to keep clean. In addition, stainless steel counters do not require sealing or polishing, which can save time and money in the long run. As a result, stainless steel may be a more cost-effective option for those looking to install new kitchen countertops.", " Buy Cheap Sofas & Couches Online in Australia | Afterpay Sofas Online \u2013 Factory Buys": "Sofa & Couches - Misty 5-Seater Modular Chaise Suite Couch Sofa Lounge - Dark GreyRRP $2,420.47Regular price $1,219.20Save $1,201Sale price Now $1,219.20 Regular priceUnit price per - Meleena 3-Seater PU Leather Sofa Bed - BlackRRP $733.69Regular price $429.15Save $305Sale price Now $429.15 Regular priceUnit price per - Matilda 3-Seater Linen Futon Sofa Bed Lounge - Light GreyRRP $1,131.73Regular price $614.95Save $517Sale price Now $614.95 Regular priceUnit price per - Merryn 2-Seater Suede Folding Floor Sofa Bed Lounge - CharcoalRRP $312.39Regular price $179.18Save $133Sale price Now $179.18 Regular priceUnit price per - Mackenzie Portable Folding Sofa Bed Ottoman Lounge - GreyRRP $462.21 (Was $254.05)Regular price $214.87Sale price Now $214.87 Save $247!

How Do I Choose the Right Style of TV Unit for My Home? When buying a TV unit, consider the following factors to ensure you find the perfect fit for your home and television: Design and Style: Choose a TV unit that complements your home's interior design and your style. Consider the materials, finishes, and colours best suit your space. Storage: Evaluate your storage needs, such as space for media players, gaming consoles, DVDs, or other accessories. Look for a TV unit with shelves, drawers, or cabinets to accommodate your storage requirements. Cable Management: Opt for a TV unit with built-in cable management features, such as holes or channels, to help organise and conceal cords for a cleaner, clutter-free look. Functionality: Consider whether you need additional features like adjustable shelves, built-in mounts, or swivelling mechanisms for optimal viewing angles. Durability and Material: Select a TV unit made from high-quality materials that can withstand daily use and support the weight of your TV. Wood, metal, and glass are common materials, each with advantages and disadvantages. By considering these factors, you can choose a TV unit that meets your needs and enhances your living space's overall appearance and functionality. What Size TV Unit Should I Buy? Measure your TV and the available space in your room to determine the size of the TV unit. Ensure that the unit can support the weight and dimensions of your TV. Also, consider the width of the stand, as it should be wider than the TV base to prevent accidental bumps or tipping. Can a TV Unit Be Used for Storage? A TV unit can double as a storage centre too! Whether you decide to fill it with books, CD\u2019s, or toys, there\u2019s plenty of room and shelves that you can find to suit your liking.", " Buy Cheap Recliner Chairs | Recliner Chairs for Sale Online \u2013 Factory Buys": "Recliner Chairs - Brigid Electric Recliner Chair Lift Heated Massage Chair Lounge Sofa Leather - BlackRRP $1,046.64Regular price $594.32Save $452Sale price Now $594.32 Regular priceUnit price per - Zephyr Electric Massage Chair Recliner Shiatsu Zero Gravity Heating Massager - BlackRRP $2,931.49Regular price $1,709.22Save $1,222Sale price Now $1,709.22 Regular priceUnit price per - Calypso Luxury Recliner Chair Lounge Armchair Sofa Fabric Cover - GreyRRP $504.56Regular price $284.64Save $220Sale price Now $284.64 Regular priceUnit price per - Kamira Recliner Chair Gaming Racing Armchair Lounge Sofa Chair Leather - BlackRRP $574.99Regular price $254.39Save $321Sale price Now $254.39 Regular priceUnit price per - Cora Recliner Chair Armchair Lounge Sofa Chair Couch Leather with Tray Table - BlackRRP $1,264.97Regular price $664.96Save $600Sale price Now $664.96 Regular priceUnit price per - Medea Recliner Chair Electric Lift Chair Armchair Lounge Fabric Sofa USB Charge - GreyRRP $2,019.12 (Was $1,134.96)Regular price $1,109.66Sale price Now $1,109.66 Save $909!

How do you take care of leather recliner chairs? Embrace the quality and luxury of leather. With regular maintenance, you can extend the life and look of your leather recliner chair and keep it looking like new for years to come. Taking care of leather recliner chairs is easy and cheap! With a leather recliner chair, you can easily maintain the look of luxury without spending a lot of money on upkeep. The key to keeping your luxurious leather recliner chair looking its best is a regular routine. Dust the entire chair regularly, use a damp cloth or vacuum to remove any particles that may have gathered in creases, avoid putting wet items on the viewing surface. And one thing that people often forget about is pet hair. So make sure you vacuum it out regularly too! The key is to invest in the right cleaners and conditioners for leather and follow the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning and conditioning the chair. A thorough cleaning should happen at least once every three months, followed by replenishing natural oils with a specialized conditioner. Along with this, avoid leaving leather in direct sunlight \u2013 not only does the sun damage leather\u2019s surface but it can also cause discolouration. Taking good care of your leather recliner chair doesn't need to be expensive. All these steps will help you maintain the look and functionality of your pristine piece for many years! How do you take care of fabric recliner chairs? Looking for a fabric recliner chair but don't know how to maintain it? Taking care of fabric recliner chairs is actually quite simple! And you don\u2019t need to break the bank. For day-to-day cleaning, use a soft cloth with warm water and mild soap. You can also spot clean larger stains with a damp cloth, making sure you dab the area instead of rubbing or scrubbing. It's best to avoid using harsh chemicals or cleaners, as they could potentially damage the fabric. An occasional gentle fluffing will also breathe life back into your chairs! Lastly, make sure your recliner stays in great shape by rotating and flipping seat cushions regularly to help keep the wear even. With just a few simple maintenance steps you can rest assured that your cheap recliner armchair is in good shape for years on end. How often should you replace a recliner chair? If you're in the market for a cheap recliner armchair, it's important to know how often you should replace it. The answer is largely subjective and depends on your personal usage. Generally, if you use your recliner daily or multiple times a day, then its lifespan may be as little as five years. Whereas, if you only use it intermittently or sparingly, then a well-maintained recliner armchair could potentially last around 10-15 years. However, regardless of your usage frequency and how much you've invested in the chair, always taking time out for maintenance is important to keep your recliner looking and feeling great. Where can I buy cheap recliner chairs? Recliner chairs are all about comfort. So, it doesn't make sense to do something uncomfortable like going out into a store, buying a recliner chair, and carrying it home all by yourself. Instead, live in the spirit of the recliner chair, and have one delivered directly to your home with Factory Buys when you buy recliner chairs online.

Are Massage Chairs Good for You? Yes! Massage chairs can provide numerous benefits for your overall well-being. They are designed to relieve muscle tension, reduce stress, improve circulation, and promote relaxation. The therapeutic effects of massage chairs can help alleviate muscle soreness, enhance flexibility, and even provide relief from certain chronic conditions. Additionally, using a massage chair can contribute to better sleep quality and increased feelings of relaxation and rejuvenation. However, it's always advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before using a massage chair, especially if you have any underlying medical conditions. How Much Is a Massage Chair?

There\u2019s no right answer on how often you should be using a massage chair \u2013 the frequency can vary depending on personal preference and individual needs. In general, it's safe to use a massage chair for about 15-30 minutes per session a few times a week. However, it's important to listen to your body and not overdo it. If you feel any discomfort or pain during or after using the chair, it's best to reduce the frequency or duration of sessions. It's also a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide personalised advice based on your specific health condition and goals. Remember, the key is to enjoy the benefits of relaxation and stress relief without straining your body. Are Massage Chairs Effective? Massage chairs can be highly effective in providing relaxation and therapeutic benefits. They are designed to target specific areas of the body and apply various massage techniques such as kneading, rolling, and tapping. These movements can help relieve muscle tension, reduce stress, and promote blood circulation. Using a massage chair is a convenient way to enjoy the benefits of a massage in the comfort of your own home. You can unwind and relax while watching TV or engaging in other activities. Massage chairs come in different colours and styles, allowing you to choose one that matches your existing furniture, such as your TV unit. This way, you can enhance the aesthetics of your living space while enjoying the rejuvenating effects of a massage. How Can I Maintain My Massage Chair? Taking care of your massage chair is crucial to keep it in top shape and ensure longevity. Get started with these pro tips: Dive into the manufacturer's instructions \u2014 they hold the key to proper maintenance, as each massage chair is different. Make cleaning a regular affair \u2014 wipe away dirt and sweat with a damp cloth. Keep your massage chair away from UV exposure, which can damage the chair\u2019s upholstery.

Customers Rated Us 4.4/5! A hallway is often one of the first places that guests see when they enter your home, so you want to make sure that it\u2019s welcoming and inviting. A hall table can help to create a warm and inviting space. It can be used to store important items like your keys and mail, and can also be used to display favourite photos or decorative items.

Whether you\u2019re looking for a small hallway console or a larger hall cabinet, you\u2019ll be able to find the perfect piece of furniture to suit your needs.

What Size Hall Table Do I Need? Hallway tables come in all shapes and sizes, which can make it difficult to choose the right one for your space. Determining the size of hall table you need depends on the size of your hallway and the amount of space you want the table to take up. A hallway console is typically between 75 and 90 centimetres wide, while a hall cabinet is usually at least 105 centimetres wide. A hallway buffet can be either narrow or wide, but is typically at least 140 centimetres wide. And a hallway desk is usually at least 150 centimetres wide. If you have a small hallway, you might want to consider a hallway console or hall cabinet. These pieces are typically shorter and narrower, making them ideal for tighter spaces. If you have a larger hallway, you might want to opt for a hallway buffet or hallway desk. These pieces are typically wider and taller, giving you more room to work with. No matter what size hallway table you choose, be sure to measure your space before making your purchase. This will ensure that the piece fits perfectly in your hallway and doesn't overwhelm the space. How To Choose A Hall Table Hallway console, hall cabinet, hallway buffet, hallway desk. These are all important pieces of furniture in a home, but how do you know which one is right for your hallway? Here are a few things to consider when choosing a hall table: - The size of the piece - make sure to measure your hallway before you shop, so you know what size table will fit. You don't want something that's too small or too big for the space. - The style of the piece - think about the overall style of your home, and choose a table that fits with that. If you have a modern home, you might want a sleek and simple hallway console. If your home is more traditional, a hall cabinet or buffet might be more your style. - The function of the piece - what do you want to use your hall table for? If you just need somewhere to drop your keys and mail when you come in the door, a small hallway desk might be enough. But if you want to use it for storage as well, look for a piece with drawers or shelves. How Wide Should A Hall Table Be? Width is very important when it comes to a hall table. Too wide and it will interfere with the functionality of your space. Too slim and it simply won\u2019t be practical. The width of your hallway table should be considered in relation to the rest of your space. A long, angular hallway will require a relatively narrow hall table \u2014 around 30cm will do nicely. If this is the type of room you are working with, why not consider our Artiss Ratan Console Table? At 35cm wide, this rattan hall table is broad enough to serve a practical purpose without interfering with the functionality of your space. If, on the other hand, you\u2019re planning to place your console table in a larger room \u2014 like your living room, for example \u2014 you are not bound by the same constrictions and can look beyond a narrow hall table. The Berne Sideboard may be a more appropriate option, with its vintage finish, ample storage space, and all-around charming vibes. How Tall Should A Hall Table Be? The height of your hall table should be considered from a practical standpoint. Traditionally, hallway tables are quite tall. They tend to have an elongating effect on a room and also provide an appropriate surface to drop your wallet, keys, phone, and other items. Of course, a table that is too high will look awkward and out of place. Consider the position of other elements in the room, including decorative features like mirrors, umbrella stands, artwork, and even light fixtures. Find a table that is an appropriate height in relation to these items. Factory Buys\u2019 comprehensive line of hall tables includes surfaces of all different shapes and sizes. Our best-selling Artiss Buffet Sideboard stands at a handy 63cm tall and makes a great addition to any living space. If you\u2019re searching for something a little taller, why not consider the Artiss Console Table? At 80cm high, it\u2019s perfect for a hallway or lounge area that requires a touch of class and elegance. How Do You Style A Hall Table? Any way you like! The great thing about having a hallway table is that it offers an excellent opportunity to show off your personal style and interior decorating skills. Try creating a focal point on your white hall table by placing a beautiful flowering plant, complete with a stylish pot. Hang a round mirror above the table to create the illusion of extra space in your hallway. Style the surface with an eye-catching sculpture \u2014 it\u2019s completely up to you. Keep in mind that your table should, to a certain extent, be functional. There needs to be space for people to leave personal items, like their keys. An overcrowded hall buffet table will only detract from the ambience of the room.

Factory Buys\u2019 comprehensive product line contains a number of different hallway tables to suit all styles and aesthetics.

We have big armchairs for big people, small armchairs for little people (like small children and the Veronicas), and even big armchairs for little people and little armchairs for big people (if, for whatever reason, that's how you want to play it). That's sizes taken care of, but what about styles? Well, you'll be happy to know that we've got great styles to choose from as well. From traditional style armchairs to contemporary modern arm chairs, there's something to suit every aesthetic impulse conceivable. Armchairs in Australia, delivered to you Nothing is worse than trying to fit an armchair into a car, or onto public transport, or even carrying the armchair back from the store on your own legs. There is an easier, better way. Just buy an armchair from Factory Buys, and we will have your armchair delivered to your home. That way, it'll be easier logistically, and easier on your arms. Affordable armchairs? It's true! You might be living under the misapprehension that armchairs are all enormously expensive, and that you'll never be able to afford one. In reality, nothing could be further from the truth. While, assuredly, armchairs can be expensive, they don't have to be. You can get a lovely, comfortable armchair for a very low price, if you know where to look. And, as it happens, you do know where to look, because you're already looking at it.

Customers Rated Us 4.4/5! Do you ever feel like your office chair is just a pain in the neck? Is your back sore from sitting down the whole day? Do you ever think, \u2018I really need a massage\u2019 but never get around to it? Well, maybe it's time to try a massage office chair! Massage chairs are designed to provide relief from muscle tension and stress by kneading into your shoulders, back, hips and thighs while you sit on them. They come with a variety of massage settings that target different muscle groups with different intensities. And best of all, they can help you stay focused and productive at work. If you're looking for an office chair that will give you a massage, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, make sure to choose a chair with adjustable massage settings. This way, you can find the perfect massage intensity for your needs. Second, look for a massage office chair with heat options. Heat can help to loosen stiff muscles and improve circulation. And finally, choose a chair that's comfortable to sit in for long periods of time. If you're looking for a massage office chair that checks all the boxes, we've got just the thing. Our massage chairs are designed for comfort and productivity, and they come with a variety of massage settings to suit your needs. Are Massage Chairs Good for Work? The short answer is: Yes! According to the Journal of Medicine, a massage chair is a cost-effective treatment for pain control and quality of life. Four out of five adults experience lower back pain at some point in their life which could be a result of sitting for too long. If you work long hours and don't have the time to see a physiotherapist, a massage chair can provide the relief you need to keep working at your best. If you are experiencing muscle stiffness, you may be tempted to let the chair massage you the whole day but it's actually better to do short sessions. If you massage for too long, you could aggravate the problem. Is a Massage Office Chair Worth It? Yes, massage chairs are worth it! Not only do they provide relief from pain and stress, but they can also improve your focus and productivity at work. If you spend a lot of time sitting down, a massage chair is a great investment. Not only will it help you feel better, but it will also help to enhance your gaming experience. Can you imagine being in a gaming massage chair while playing FIFA, shredding zombies or shooting noobs? That would be awesome! Here are some of the reasons why you should invest in a massage chair: Massage frequency: having a massage chair means that you can treat yourself to a massage whenever you feel like it. You won't have to beg your partner for one anymore! Cost-effective: it's cheaper to buy a massage chair than to continuously pay for massages from a massage therapist. If you have a serious ailment, then you should go see a professional physiotherapist. However, if you only have minor muscle stiffness then a massage chair is all you need. Pain relief: if you have any muscle tightness from exercise or a chronic condition, massage chairs can help to circulate the blood flow around those sore muscles. Reduce stress: if you purchase a shiatsu massage chair, then you might get some of the benefits of a shiatsu massage - like stress relief. Improved mood: pain and pleasure have a yin-yang type of relationship. There\u2019s something oddly satisfying about receiving a massage on your sore muscles. Some studies suggest that massages can improve your mood by increasing your level of endorphins, serotonin and dopamine. Better sleep: with the above benefits of pain relief, reduced stress and improved mood you will find it easier to fall asleep at night. If you're an insomniac or someone who travels a lot, you may benefit from the improved sleep that massage chairs can provide. Just don't fall asleep with it on!

A sit to stand desk, also known as a standing desk or height-adjustable desk, is a type of desk that allows the user to switch between sitting and standing positions while working. It typically features a height-adjustable surface that can be raised or lowered to accommodate the user's preferred position, and may also include a footrest to provide support while standing. The benefits of using a sit to stand desk include improved posture, reduced back pain, increased energy and productivity, and lower risk of obesity and other health problems associated with prolonged sitting. Many people find that alternating between sitting and standing throughout the day helps them stay focused and engaged, and can even reduce feelings of fatigue and stress. Sit to stand desks are becoming increasingly popular in workplaces and home offices, as more people recognise the benefits of a more active and flexible approach to working. Are sit stand desks good for you? Yes, sit stand desks can be good for you in many ways. By allowing you to alternate between sitting and standing positions, they can help reduce the health risks associated with prolonged sitting, such as back pain, poor posture, and increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Standing more frequently can also help increase energy and productivity, improve circulation, and reduce stress levels. However, it's important to note that using a sit stand desk alone is not a cure-all solution for these health problems. It's important to also practice good ergonomic habits, such as using proper posture and taking regular breaks, to get the most benefit from your desk. Additionally, it's important to ease into using a sit stand desk gradually, as standing for too long can also cause its own set of problems. How much is a sit stand desk? At Factory Buys, the price of a sit stand desk can vary depending on the model and features. We offer a range of affordable options to suit different budgets, with budget models available in the low hundreds all the way to premium electric models in the high hundreds. Our sit stand desks are designed to provide high-quality, ergonomic solutions for both home and office settings, allowing you to work comfortably and productively. Check out our website or get in touch with us to find the best sit stand desk for your needs and budget. Where to buy a sit stand desk?

Our online store makes it easy to shop for sit stand desks from the comfort of your own home, with fast shipping and easy returns.

Electric sit stand desks can be worth it if you prioritise convenience, flexibility, and ergonomics. They allow you to easily adjust the height of your desk with the push of a button, making it easy to switch between sitting and standing positions throughout the day. This can help reduce the health risks associated with prolonged sitting, increase energy and productivity, and improve overall comfort.

Wooden filing cabinets are a popular choice for both home and office settings, as they offer a classic look and feel. However, wooden filing cabinets can be more expensive than other options. If you're on a budget, you may want to consider a metal filing cabinet. Metal cabinets are also available in a variety of colors and styles, so you can find one that complements your existing d\u00e9cor. Another important consideration is the number of drawers you need. If you have a large volume of paperwork to store, you'll need a cabinet with multiple drawers. Plan ahead and measure the space where the cabinet will go before making your purchase; this will ensure that you buy a filing cabinet that fits perfectly in your designated spot. With a little bit of planning, you can find the perfect filing cabinet for your needs. What Is A Filing Cabinet Used For? A filing cabinet is an essential piece of office furniture that helps organise and secure important documents. Don\u2019t let the term \u2018office furniture\u2019 fool you \u2014 filing cabinets can also be used in a home environment for the same purposes. Sick of keeping your bills and important receipts scattered around the home? A filing cabinet is exactly what you need. You could even use a small filing cabinet to store mementos from your children \u2014 their artwork, birthday cards, school certificates, and more. Traditional filing cabinets have a drawer that slides open to reveal a suspension rail on which you can hang individual files and label them as required. These days, this type of cabinet is often combined with other drawers to create the ultimate, one-stop storage system. What Types Of Filing Cabinets Are There? As organisation and filing needs have evolved, filing cabinets have changed considerably. Once upon a time all cabinets basically came in the same size, shape, and colour. These days, you can purchase a set of filing drawers to suit any need or situation. The most common type of cabinet is the traditional vertical filing cabinet, which operates as either a single drawer filing cabinet or maximises space by stacking one set of filing cabinet drawers on top of the other. Factory Buys\u2019 5 Drawer Filing Cabinet is a perfect example of this. Available in stunning red and blue, it has been constructed using the finest materials and craftsmanship. Made from heavy-duty stainless steel and highly resistant to rust and corrosion, the 5 Drawer Filing Cabinet fits perfectly in a home or office environment thanks to its compact size, set of multiple filing cabinet drawers, and built-in wheels. Looking for something a little more unassuming? Our Wood Filing Cabinet is compact, modest, and more than gets the job done. This 2 drawer filing cabinet is the perfect space-saving solution for your home office or will fit neatly underneath your desk at work. In addition to the substantial filing drawer, you benefit from a smaller stationary drawer on the top that allows you to easily organise pens, pencils, and other loose items. If you\u2019ve been on the lookout for a wooden filing cabinet, we recommend checking this one out! Finally, if you\u2019re searching for an organisation system that\u2019s a little different to the traditional suspension rail cabinet, consider our Steel Rack Home Organiser, for example. With three internal partitions that can be repositioned as required, this cabinet is the perfect size to slot right into your home office setup. Built with anti-rust steel, this white filing cabinet is both durable and stylish. As you can tell, there are plenty of different types of filing cabinets out there. Don\u2019t let yourself be trapped into thinking your only option is a boring, traditional, grey cabinet. Enjoy browsing Factory Buys\u2019 comprehensive range of products to find one that suits your needs and aesthetic perfectly. Are File Cabinets Becoming Obsolete? Of course not! There will always be a need to store important files and documents in an organised manner. While it has become more commonplace to keep digital copies of documents, there\u2019s something to be said for the peace of mind that having a physical piece of paper brings. Records stored digitally can always be hacked, tampered with, or removed. A physical copy can be stored safely and securely, away from prying eyes. Having a wooden filing cabinet is particularly useful in a home environment. No doubt you\u2019ve got copies of important documents you want to keep organised and secure \u2014 birth certificates, marriage licenses, house deeds, and more. Perhaps at the moment these files are scattered throughout your house or stuffed in the bottom of a messy drawer. Imagine the peace of mind that will come from having all your confidential and important files in one location that can be easily and efficiently accessed.

Customers Rated Us 4.4/5! The need for a high-quality gaming chair is often seen as being less important than other comfort purchases such as a mattress. But if you\u2019re someone who games as a primary pastime, and if you work from home, it\u2019s likely that you sit in your chair almost as much as you sleep on your mattress. So it definitely pays to have a quality throne for you to perch on. The Importance of Comfort and Ergonomics in Gaming Chairs Just as a good mattress is crucial for a good night's sleep, a high-quality gaming chair is essential for a comfortable gaming experience. Prolonged sitting can lead to an array of health problems such as back pain, poor posture, and even carpal tunnel syndrome. Gaming chairs, however, are specifically engineered to combat these issues. They come with adjustable features such as armrests, seat height, and backrests that allow you to customise your seating position, promoting good posture and reducing the risk of discomfort. Additional cushions for lumbar and neck support ensure that every part of your body is comfortably supported throughout your gaming sessions. The Different Styles of Gaming Chairs Available at Factory Buys At Factory Buys, we understand that every gamer has unique needs and preferences. That's why we offer a variety of gaming chairs to cater to every individual. For those who prefer a sporty aesthetic, our racing-style gaming chairs are a perfect fit. They offer the perfect combination of comfort and style, enveloping you in plush comfort as you navigate your favourite gaming worlds. For those who want their gaming setup to double as a professional workspace, our executive-style gaming chairs seamlessly blend professional aesthetics with gaming-chair ergonomics. Material and Durability Our gaming chairs are designed not just for comfort and style but also for durability. We utilise materials such as leather, fabric, and mesh, each offering unique benefits. Leather chairs offer a luxurious feel and are easy to clean, making them an ideal choice for marathon gaming sessions. Fabric chairs, on the other hand, are breathable and provide a cosy, warm seating surface. Mesh chairs combine breathability with a lightweight design, perfect for those who\u2019re gaming in warmer climates. Whichever material you choose, you can trust that Factory Buys chairs are built to last. Aesthetic Appeal of Gaming Chairs Gaming chairs aren't just about comfort and functionality; they're also about expressing your personal style. At Factory Buys, our gaming chairs come in a variety of designs and colours, so whether you prefer a sleek, minimalist look or a bold, vibrant design, you're sure to find a chair that complements your aesthetic.

Jump into Factory Buys today for the best gaming chairs at the lowest prices. Shop online now! What Are the Best Gaming Chairs? The best gaming chairs are those that combine comfort, durability, and functionality. They should have ergonomic features like adjustable seat height, armrests, and lumbar support to promote good posture during long gaming sessions. High-quality materials that are both comfortable and durable are also crucial. Some top models may also include features like a recline function, footrest, or even built-in speakers. At Factory Buys, we offer a range of gaming chairs that meet all of these criteria and more. Each of our gaming chairs is designed to offer optimal comfort and support for every gaming enthusiast. Are Gaming Chairs Worth It? Investing in a gaming chair is definitely worth it, especially if you spend extended hours gaming or working at your desk. Gaming chairs are designed with ergonomics in mind to support proper posture, reducing the risk of back pain and other discomforts associated with sitting for long periods. The adjustable features allow you to customise the chair to fit your body and seating preferences perfectly. It\u2019s also no secret that a bit of aesthetic appeal really makes a good gaming chair. The seats on sale at Factory Buys are sure to be comfortable and stylish in equal measure. How Do You Choose a Gaming Chair? Picking a gaming chair is a choice that requires you to weigh up a few key factors. Start with comfort and ergonomics; look for chairs with adjustable height, backrests, armrests, and lumbar support. The material of the chair is also essential. Leather and fabric chairs are popular choices, each offering different comfort levels and maintenance requirements. Style is another consideration, especially for gamers who want their chair to reflect their personal aesthetic or match their gaming setup. Lastly, consider your budget and the chair's durability to ensure it's a worthwhile long-term investment. What Types of Gaming Chairs Do Factory Buys Sell?

What Is the Difference Between a Bookshelf and a Bookcase? The terms bookshelf and bookcase are often used interchangeably, but there are some key differences between them. A bookshelf is typically an open storage unit that has horizontal shelves for holding books or other items, such as furnishings or decorations. A bookcase, however, is a larger piece of furniture with a solid back and it sometimes has many shelves or sections dividing the space. Bookcases are generally taller and wider than bookshelves and offer more storage space. They can also be enclosed; if you wish to keep your written treasures dust free, these types are especially great if the item is valuable. When deciding between a bookshelf and a bookcase, consider your storage needs, available space, and preferred style. What Are the Different Types of Bookshelves? There are so many different types of bookshelves available, catering to a range of styles and aesthetics. Vintage, abstract, practical \u2013 you name it! We\u2019ve got it here at Factory Buys. Some of the different types of bookshelves for sale include floating shelves, bracket shelves, corner shelves, and ladder shelves. Each type offers unique features and benefits, such as space-saving designs, versatility, and ease of installation. When choosing the right type of shelf for your needs, consider the size and weight of the items you will be storing, the available space, and your preferred style. How Do I Choose a Bookcase for My Space? Choosing the right bookcase for your space involves several factors, including size, style, and storage needs. Measure the size of the available area and select a bookcase that will fit comfortably without crowding the space. You don\u2019t want a bookcase to overpower the room, you want it to complement the other furniture and blend into your space.

What Size Is a Double Bed Mattress? A double bed mattress typically measures around 135 centimetres in width and 190 centimetres in length. It provides a comfortable sleeping space for two adults, allowing for enough room to stretch out and move during the night. The dimensions of a double bed mattress can vary slightly depending on the manufacturer or region, but this is the standard size that is most commonly used. It's worth noting that there are also variations of double mattresses, such as the \"small double\" or \"three-quarter\" size, which may have slightly different dimensions. When choosing a double bed mattress, it's important to consider your specific needs, the available space in your bedroom, and your comfort preferences. If you want to spread out even more, you might want to invest in a king-size mattress or queen-bed mattress. What Size Bed Frame Do I Need for a Double Mattress? Whether you\u2019re sharing your new mattress with someone else or you\u2019ve got it all to yourself, there\u2019s plenty of room to spread out with our selection of double bed mattresses. If you\u2019re upgrading from your single mattress to a double, chances are that you\u2019ll also need double-bed frame. Luckily, we stock those too! To accommodate a double mattress, you will need a bed frame that matches its dimensions. A standard double mattress typically measures around 135 centimetres in width and 190 centimetres in length, so it's important to look for a bed frame specifically designed for these measurements. The bed frame should provide proper support and a secure fit for the mattress to ensure stability and prevent any sagging or movement. It's recommended to consider the overall style, material, and features of the bed frame that align with your preferences and bedroom decor. Double-check the specifications provided by the manufacturer to ensure a proper fit, allowing you to enjoy a comfortable and well-supported sleep surface. To take the guesswork out of buying a double mattress and frame separately, we offer them together! Our mattress packages come with everything you need to enjoy a comfortable new bed \u2013 minus the stress of all the measuring. How Thick Is a Double Bed Mattress? The thickness of a double bed mattress can vary depending on multiple factors, including the specific model, brand, and mattress type. Generally speaking, double bed mattresses range from 15 to 30 centimetres (six to 12 inches) in thickness. Thicker mattresses tend to offer more cushioning and a plush feel, which is perfect for sinking into at the end of a long day. Thinner mattresses, on the other hand, can provide a firmer sleep surface, great for those who prefer a bit more support. When choosing a double bed mattress, consider your comfort preferences and any size limitations you might have in your bedroom. So, go ahead and find the perfect thickness for your cosy dreamland! What Do I Need to Look for in a Double Mattress? There are several things that you need to look out for when you\u2019re in the market for a cheap double mattress. Consider the size, comfort level, and material of the mattress, as you don\u2019t want to be uncomfortable. Look for a mattress with the right level of firmness or softness to suit your preferences. When shopping for a new mattress, opt for high-quality materials to ensure durability. It\u2019s also essential to set a budget and find a mattress that balances quality and affordability \u2013 which is why Factory Buys is the perfect place to invest in a new double mattress!

King Single Bed Dimensions If you\u2019re wondering about the size of a single bed, here\u2019s all the information you need. A single bed is typically 92 x 188 centimetres. A king single bed, on the other hand, is 107 x 203cm. This extra length and width can make a huge amount of difference for those of us who are a bit on the taller side! If you're looking for a king single bed frame that's both stylish and functional, there are a few things you'll want to keep in mind. Firstly, consider the material the bed frame is made from. Metal frames are typically more durable and longer-lasting than wooden ones, but they can also be quite heavy and difficult to move around. If you're not planning on moving your bed frame very often, metal may be the way to go. Secondly, take a look at the design of the bed frame. If you're looking for something that's both stylish and comfortable, you'll want to choose a bed frame with a headboard and footboard. This will allow you to prop yourself up while reading or watching TV in bed, and it can also add a bit of extra storage space to your room. Get A Solid Bed Base, A King Single Head Board, King Single Bed Slats, And More Looking for a bed frame with a headboard king single style? Have a look at the Celle Bed Frame. This beautiful frame comes with a solid bed base, king single bed slats, and a gas-lift platform that allows you to use the under-bed area as additional storage. With clean and smooth edges giving the whole thing a modern style, this solid wood, foam, fabric, and steel construction is upholstered for extra comfort. The gorgeous charcoal colour will suit any home decor and offer you a cosy and stylish night\u2019s sleep. Charcoal not your thing? Pick a colour you like! Get a single king bed white, black, grey, and more. Find A King Single Bed With Trundle A king single trundle is an awesome way to fit a spare bed in your house without having to worry too much about storage. Whether you\u2019ve got relatives, friends, or any other guests staying over, having an extra place for them to sleep can be a hassle without a trundle bed.

When it comes to selecting the perfect outdoor seating option, there's no wrong answer! Cheap outdoor chairs in metal and plastic can provide a more modern, contemporary look in your backyard oasis, while wooden outdoor chairs can add that rustic charm. For those looking for a classic wooden look, there is a wide range of wooden outdoor chairs made from hardwood such as teak and mahogany, so you can find one to fit any aesthetic. Do you prefer something extra cushy and luxurious? Check out our selection of outdoor recliners to really make yourself comfortable! In just minutes, these chairs transform your outdoor space into an oasis where one can relax and reflect or enjoy the company of loved ones. But whatever type you choose, one thing is for sure: once you get the right seating, your outdoor area will be a beautiful haven for you and your family. Check out the range of excellent outdoor seating options from Factory Buys. What types of outdoor chairs are available? There are various types of outdoor chairs available, such as wooden outdoor chairs, wicker chair and table sets, outdoor recliners, metal chair sets, and more. Other types of outdoor chairs include metal chairs, wicker chairs, and plastic chairs, each with their own pros and cons. It's essential to consider factors such as style, comfort, durability, maintenance, and budget when choosing the right outdoor chairs for your space. When you\u2019re picking outdoor chairs, keep in mind that this furniture has to match your outdoor space. So make sure that your chairs and tables match with your decor and theme. Bonus points for creating a cohesive indoor-outdoor theme. If the style of your outdoor furniture aligns with your indoor furniture, then the transition between both spaces becomes much smoother. Not to mention, when you blend the exterior with the interior, your home will look professionally decorated. Can you leave wooden chairs outside? Cheap outdoor chairs made of wood can be a great solution to seating needs outdoors. Wooden outdoor chairs are durable, provide support and are usually weatherproof. However, they require proper maintenance to prevent damage from moisture, sun exposure, and pests. If left outside without protection, wooden chairs can warp, crack, or rot over time, reducing their beauty and lifespan. It's recommended to cover wooden chairs when not in use or to store them in a dry and sheltered area during the off-season. Even though it is not recommended to leave your wooden outdoor furniture outside all year round, there is a range of chairs from low maintenance designs like the classic benches to larger swings to folding chairs. Other options for more comfort include outdoor recliners that can be left outside even when the weather takes a turn for the worse! No matter what type of chair you choose, you can find an option in wood perfect for your next outdoor gathering. Can you leave rattan chairs outdoors? Rattan chairs, also known as wicker chairs, are a great choice for inexpensive, stylish outdoor seating. You might think that wooden chairs would last longer outdoors, but a rattan chair is also very sturdy and weatherproof if treated correctly. Rattan chairs and bar stools are suitable for outdoor use as they are made of natural fibres that are resistant to moisture and sun damage. However, they require regular cleaning and maintenance to prevent mould, mildew, and discolouration. It's also recommended to store rattan chairs in a dry and sheltered area during the off-season or to cover them with a protective cover. How do I decide between rattan and timber furniture? Choosing between rattan and timber furniture depends on individual preferences, budget, and style. If you prefer lightweight and easy-to-maintain furniture with a natural and airy look, rattan furniture may be a good choice for you. On the other hand, if you prefer sturdy and durable furniture with a classic and timeless look, timber furniture may be a better option. It's important to consider factors such as maintenance and weather resistance before making your final decision. While rattan offers a cheaper option for those looking for some affordable outdoor chairs, wooden outdoor chairs provide a robust build that will last for years to come - plus, there are plenty of designs to choose from. For those who want to kick back after a hard day's work, an outdoor recliner in either material is also an excellent choice, as it allows you to relax in style and comfort. So ultimately, it comes down to preference. Whatever you choose, both rattan and timber furniture are sure to give you a beautiful backyard space. Where can I buy cheap outdoor furniture? Looking for an upgrade to your outdoor furniture setup? Look no further! Cheap outdoor chairs, wooden outdoor chairs, and outdoor recliners are all available at Factory Buys at incredible prices. Order from the comfort of your home. Shopping around for the best deal on quality furniture doesn't have to be a hassle - find the perfect piece for you and both your wallet and home will thank you.

Customers Rated Us 4.4/5! A folding picnic table is a great addition to any home, especially if you enjoy hosting outdoor parties or barbecues. They're also convenient for picnics and camping trips. Folding tables are typically made of plastic or metal. Some have built-in benches, while others are freestanding. Collapsible tables are ideal for small spaces since they can be easily stored away when not in use. Here's everything you need to know about folding picnic tables. Advantages of Folding Picnic Tables Folding picnic tables have many advantages over traditional picnic tables. First, they're much more space-efficient since they can be easily collapsed and stored away when not in use. This makes them ideal for small homes or apartments where space is limited. Second, they're much lighter and easier to transport than traditional picnic tables, making them perfect for picnics, camping trips or tailgating parties. Third, many folding tables come with built-in benches, which saves you the hassle of having to bring separate chairs. How to Choose the Best Folding Picnic Table When shopping for a folding picnic table, there are several things to keep in mind. First, consider the material. Plastic tables are the lightest and most affordable option, but they're not as durable as metal or wood tables. Metal tables are very durable but can be heavy and difficult to transport. Second, consider the size of the table. If you have a large family or entertain often, you'll need a larger table. Third, consider whether you want a table with built-in benches or not. Built-in benches can save space and hassle. Folding Tables For Camping & Parties Folding picnic tables are invaluable when you\u2019re camping. Other than a tree stump or the odd rock, nature has very few flat surfaces raised to the perfect height for playing cards, a board game, or eating a meal. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to take a fold-up camping table with you when camping. These fold-out camping cooking tables are easy to store and transport, making them portable and perfect for your upcoming camping adventure. From the small fold up table to a bigger folding camping bench seat table with built-in chairs, we stock a vast variety of camp furniture. A Cheap Collapsible Table Can Bring the Family Together Even a small camping table can make a difference to the vibe at camp. There\u2019s something innately human and decent about sitting around a table with family \u2014 and it almost doesn\u2019t matter what it is you\u2019re doing. Whether it\u2019s breakfast, arm wrestling, brunch, board games, lunch, poker, dinner, or any other meal/activity. A camping table can foster bonding and an atmosphere of togetherness. Fold Away Dining Tables to Get The Party Started The foldable table is often the unsung hero of a party. You\u2019re stressed out, wondering where to put all the chips, dips and napkins, and then all of a sudden, cheap camping tables come to the rescue. And when the party is over, these fold-away tables don\u2019t overstay their welcome. The joy of a fold away table is that you can simply fold it away, pop it in the shed, and not have to think about it until the next party (or camping trip). A Folding Table WIth Storage To Take Work With You Some people love to head out camping to get away from their work. Other people, however, simply love to work while they\u2019re camping. They might be working at writing their novel, drawing the splendours of nature, or even just doing their white-collar city work in the great outdoors. For those industrious individuals, we recommend investing in a fold-up desk. Contact Us About Your New Folding Picnic Table Factory Buys has a huge range of folding tables on offer, and we\u2019re right here to give you a hand with your new purchase.

Bestway inflatable pools, pool toys, and more Have fun in the sun with Bestway inflatable pool toys and more The word \u2018inflatable\u2019 means \u2018capable of being filled with air\u2019. But in a more general and poetic sense, \u2018inflatable\u2019 means \u2018ready to have a great time\u2019. There\u2019s nothing more Australian than having fun in the summer with inflatable activities, and the best inflatable activities come from Bestway. At Factory Buys, we sell heaps of excellent Bestway products. From Bestway inflatable pools to the Bestway inflatable boat and even a Bestway inflatable island, you\u2019ll be blown away. Bestway inflatable fun for the whole family There are Bestway inflatable toys that everybody can enjoy. You don\u2019t have to be young to frolic on a slip and slide \u2014 just young at heart. And everybody from kids to the elderly can find pleasure in a Bestway inflatable pool. Whether you\u2019re relaxing with a book or stirring up trouble with an impish splash, every member of the family will love these Bestway inflatable items. Cheap Bestway inflatable pools A permanent swimming pool is an enormously expensive and time consuming purchase. Not only do you have to endure the expense of installing the pool, you also have to take care of it, clean it, put up a fence, and practice fierce vigilance to chase away any hoodlums who try to swim in your pool while you\u2019re not looking. Things are much better and simpler with a Bestway inflatable pool. Just blow up the pool, fill it with water from a tap, and enjoy. And when you\u2019re done, just pour out the water, deflate the pool, and store it in a convenient location. The best way to improve your pool? Bestway inflatable pool toys! You\u2019re floating around in your pool, bored out of your mind, wondering what has gone wrong. The answer, invariably, is that you\u2019ve forgotten your Bestway inflatable pool toy.

What are the Benefits of Buying a Single Bed and Mattress Package? 1. More Affordable One of the primary benefits of buying a single bed and mattress package is that it is more affordable than buying the items separately. When you buy a bed and mattress separately, you have to pay for two separate items, which can add up quickly. However, when you buy a package, you only have to pay for one collective item, which can save you a significant amount of money. 2. More Convenient Another benefit of buying a single bed and mattress package is that it is more convenient than buying the items separately. When you buy a package, you only have to deal with one purchase, which can save you time and hassle. 3. Compatability Another benefit of buying a single bed and mattress package is that it usually results in a better quality product. When manufacturers sell beds and mattresses together as a package, they are able to ensure that the products are compatible with each other. Additionally, when you buy a package, you can be sure that the bed and mattress will be made from high-quality materials that will last for years to come.", " Buy Double Bedroom Furniture Packages Online In Australia \u2013 Factory Buys": "Bedroom Packages - Double - Saturn Bed & Mattress Package - Grey DoubleRRP $1,130.45 (Was $532.73)Regular price $506.09Sale price Now $506.09 Save $624!

After a long day at work, dealing with annoying colleagues and horrible bosses, there\u2019s nothing better than sinking into a convertible chair, popping the legs up, and unwinding. For kids, it can be just the same. After a tiering day at school, enduring simple minded teachers and frustrating classmates, few pleasures rival sinking into a child-sized convertible chair, raising up those tired little legs, and settling into a reclined position. Convertible chairs for kid-sized comfort For too long, children had no option but to sit in convertible arm chairs that were intended for an adult\u2019s body. This was a sad state of affairs but, mercifully, it has now been remedied. At Factory Buys, we stock a huge range of kids convertible arm chairs sized for little people. Now, kids can enjoy the comfort of their own chair, without having to struggle with oversized dimensions. Convertible chairs for kids to suit decor and vibe You\u2019re probably all too familiar with how picky kids can be with their food, but did you know that some children can be just as picky with their tastes in interior design? It\u2019s true! While an older generation grew up watching cartoons and sports, the generation today have often watched countless hours of The Block, Queer Eye, Amazing Interiors, Grand Designs, and so on. Comfort isn\u2019t the only criterion for kids arm chairs. You\u2019ve also got to pick one that goes with their personal tastes in design. Not to mention the fact that it\u2019s your house, and it should be something you don\u2019t mind looking at either. Get kids convertible chairs on after pay You don\u2019t have to scrimp and save for years to buy a kids convertible chair. Just use Afterpay, and get it ASAP. With Afterpay, your repayments will be split into smaller parts and charged to your account over a series of weeks. And the best bit is, there\u2019s no interest on that deal.

If you're decorating for your little one and want to add some youthful flair to your own bedroom, a kids' bedroom set can be the perfect touch. The first step is figuring out your colour scheme. Do you want a bold, moody palette through a dark bed frame and accessories, or would you rather opt for soft pastels and white for a dreamy look? Adding patterns through bedding and rugs can also add visual interest. Don't be afraid to mix and match different furniture pieces and accessories - adding a pop of unexpected colour with a play mat is a great way to go. And lastly, remember to incorporate fun elements like bean bag chairs or lights stringing from the ceiling to create an inviting and playful vibe. With a kids' bedroom set and some creativity, you can easily design a room that's both colourful and cozy. What Should You Look For When Buying Kids Bedroom Furniture? When it comes to furnishing a kids' bedroom, safety should be your top priority. Look for furniture that is made from solid wood or sturdy metal, with no sharp edges or unstable components. Make sure that any dressers, shelves, and bookcases are securely anchored to the wall to prevent tipping accidents. It's also important to consider the child's age and physical abilities. If they are still in the crawling or climbing stage, choose furniture without small holes or spaces that could trap tiny fingers or toes. When selecting bunk beds or loft beds, ensure there are guardrails on all sides to prevent falls during sleep. Functionality is also key - choose desks and chairs that give good support and can accommodate your child as they grow. And lastly, don't forget about style! Choose furniture that blends with the room's overall decor while still allowing for a bit of fun and whimsy to inspire endless hours of playtime. Remember: safety first, but don't sacrifice style in the process. What Kids Bedroom Furniture is Available? Factory Buys offers an extensive range of kids' bedroom furniture.

Customers Rated Us 4.4/5! When it comes to the safety and comfort of your toddler, investing in a bed rail can be a wise decision. Not only do bed rails prevent your child from rolling or falling out of bed, they also provide peace of mind for parents. Factory Buys offers toddler bed rails to help keep your toddler safe while asleep. These bed rails are made of sturdy metal and can be attached to most toddler beds, making it difficult for your child to roll out of bed. With these rails in place, you can rest easy knowing that your toddler is safe and secure. Many bed rails feature soft mesh padding and cozy fabrics, making them a luxurious addition to any toddler's bedroom. So when shopping for your little one's bed setup, consider investing in a high-quality bed rail for added protection and comfort. It's hard to find a safe and sturdy bed rail that can be quickly adjusted to fit different mattress sizes. Not only is it difficult to find a bed rail that is both adjustable and safe, but it's also tough to assemble them correctly. If you get a bed rail that isn't sturdy, your child could easily fall out of bed during the night. The Kids Adjustable Folding Safety Bed Rail is the perfect solution for your needs. This bed rail is made of sturdy steel tubing and features quick-release drop brackets that make it easy to adjust the height to fit most mattresses (up to 28cm thick). The breathable mesh ensures your child's safety and prevents them from becoming too hot during sleep. Not to mention the adorable patterns on it to keep your little one entertained. Plus, this bed rail is easy to assemble and folds down for storage when not in use. Do Bed Rails Work For Toddlers? If you have a toddler, odds are you've worried about the dreaded middle-of-the-night tumble out of bed. Bed rails can help prevent those falls and provide a sense of security for your little one. Not only do they provide a physical barrier to keep your child from falling out of bed, but they also act as a visual cue to let them know where their boundaries are. Plus, with various styles available, it's easy to find bed rails that will complement the aesthetic of any room. So why take the risk when you can invest in a simple solution like bed rails? Give yourself and your little one some peace of mind and make the investment in bed rails today. What Age Should You Use Bed Rails For Kids? When it comes to the topic of bed rails for children, there is no one-size-fits-all answer for which age the child needs to be. The age at which bed rails are appropriate varies based on a child's individual development and level of mobility. Generally speaking, bed rails may be necessary for toddlers who are transitioning out of a crib and aren't quite ready for a full-sized bed without the added safety measure. As children grow and gain control over their movements, they may no longer need the extra support of bed rails. It's important to reassess the necessity of bed rails periodically as your child grows, and check that the rails are fixed in position with a little shake test to prevent injuries. When used correctly, bed rails can offer peace of mind and a luxurious night's sleep for both parents and children. However, it is ultimately up to each family to determine the best course of action for their individual child. What Are the Different Types of Bed Rails? When it comes to bed rails, there are several options available depending on your needs. Fixed bed rails are permanently attached to the bed frame and cannot be adjusted or removed. These can provide added stability for the bed and prevent roll-offs or falls while sleeping. Folding bed rails attach to the frame with hinges and can be lowered or elevated as needed. These are often used for individuals who need extra support while getting in and out of bed but want the option of removing them during the day. Another option is telescopic bed rails, which can extend in length to fit different-sized beds and offer adjustable height options. Finally, mesh bed rails provide both support and visibility, making them a popular choice for children's beds. Whichever type you choose, bed guard rails can offer added security and peace of mind for both individuals and caregivers. Where Can I Buy a Toddler Bed Rail? Factory Buys is the perfect place to buy toddler bed rails. With our selection of styles and sizes, you're sure to find the perfect bed safety rail for your needs. We also sell kids' playpens, along with safety gate extenders and support ramps.

At Factory Buys, we have a wide selection of Christmas inflatables and kids' inflatables in all sorts of shapes and sizes, so you\u2019re sure to find the perfect one for your needs. One of the great things about Christmas inflatables is that they\u2019re easy to set up and take down. Just plug them in, and they\u2019ll start inflating \u2013 no need for complicated assembly! And when the Christmas holidays are over, simply deflate them and store them away until next year, for as long as you need them for. How Do Christmas Inflatables Work? Christmas inflatables are basically giant air-filled sculptures that are designed to look like popular holiday icons. This can be Santa Claus, reindeer, snowmen, and many more types of festive designs. They\u2019re made out of a durable material like nylon or PVC, with an internal fan that keeps them inflated. Most inflatables come with everything you need for set-up, including the fan, stakes, and tethers. Just pick a spot outdoors (away from power lines), stake the inflatable down, plug it in, and watch it start to take shape! What Are The Benefits Of Using Inflatables For Christmas? For many years now, inflatable decorations have been lighting up more and more yards across the world, especially here in Australia. It\u2019s easy to see why \u2013 they\u2019re unique, they\u2019re fun, and they make an impression after a very quick set-up. Here are just a few of the benefits of using inflatables for your Christmas decoration needs. Eye-Catching Inflatables are big, bright, and look great! They\u2019re sure to catch the eye of anyone who passes by, and they\u2019ll definitely make your home or business stand out from the rest. Affordable Christmas inflatables are very reasonably priced, especially when you consider how much space they can cover and the impact they have. Easy To Set Up As we mentioned, most of our range already comes with the equipment necessary to secure the inflatable toy and let it inflate by itself. You just need to provide the power (in a safe environment). Versatile Christmas inflatables come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, so you\u2019re sure to find one that suits your needs. Whether you want it for a large garden or a narrow driveway, we have the right size for you. Durable Christmas inflatables are made out of tough materials like nylon or PVC so that they can withstand the elements. This can be especially important if you're living in Australia where Christmas time is regularly met with high temperatures and gusty winds! Easy To Store When the holidays are over, simply deflate your inflatable and store it away until next year. No need for a bulky storage solution \u2013 inflatables take up very little space when they\u2019re not inflated. Kids Love Them If you have kids, then you know that it can be tough to keep them occupied during such a busy time of the year \u2013 but rest assured, they\u2019ll love Christmas inflatables! They\u2019re fun, they\u2019re festive, and they keep the little ones entertained. How to Choose the Right Christmas Inflatable Now that we\u2019ve talked about all the great reasons to use inflatables for your Christmas decoration needs, let\u2019s talk about how to choose the right one! Here are a few things to keep in mind as you browse our Christmas inflatables: Size One of the most important things to consider when choosing an inflatable is size. You'll need to make sure that the inflatable you choose is the right size for your needs \u2013 too small and it will get lost in your d\u00e9cor, too big and it may not fit in the space you have! Theme Another important consideration is the theme. Christmas inflatables come in all sorts of themes, from traditional icons like Santa Claus and reindeer, to giant snowmen that give a wintery atmosphere. Power Our inflatables are generally powered by a fan at the bottom of the inflatable. In order for this fan to work most inflatables will require access to a power point. If you don\u2019t have easy access to a power point, make sure to choose an inflatable that comes with a battery pack! How Do I Keep Christmas Inflatables From Falling Over? One of the most common questions we get asked about Christmas inflatables is how to keep them from falling over. Luckily, it's easy! All you need to do is make sure that your inflatable is properly anchored to the ground. This can be done with either sandbags or stakes, depending on the type of ground you have. For soft ground like grass, sandbags are the best way to go. Simply place them around the base of your inflatable and make sure they're filled with sand or dirt. For hard surfaces like concrete or asphalt, metal stakes are the best way to secure your inflatable. Most of our outdoor inflatables come with metal stakes included.

Our range comes in a variety of sizes, including single air beds, twin, full, queen, and king. The size you choose will depend on what you\u2019re using the air mattress for, as well as the available space in the room or tent where you will be sleeping. A twin-size mattress is great for a single sleeper or for those resting in smaller spaces, while a queen or king size is more suitable for couples or larger rooms. The size you choose will depend on what you're using the air mattress for, the number of people who will be using it, and the available space in the room or tent where you will be sleeping. No matter the size of the air bed, you\u2019ll be sleeping peacefully with Factory Buys! What Should I Look for in an Air Mattress? When looking for an air mattress, there are several factors to consider \u2013 most importantly, comfort and lasting factor, which is heavily affected by the construction and material of the bed. Look for high-quality materials such as puncture-resistant PVC or reinforced vinyl for optimal durability. Consider the support level and firmness options available, as well as features like built-in pumps or adjustable settings for convenience. Also, consider the size and weight of the mattress for storage and transportation. Are Air Mattresses Good for Camping? Yes! Air mattresses can be a great option for camping. They are lightweight, easy to pack and transport, and provide a far more comfortable sleeping surface than only a mat or sleeping bag will give. Look for models with durable materials and puncture-resistant features to withstand the rigours of outdoor use. It\u2019s also important to consider the size and weight of the mattress for ease of transport and storage and look for models with built-in pumps or are compatible with portable pumps for easy inflation and deflation. Otherwise, you will have a whole heap of extra work on your hands! How Do I Inflate a Blow-Up Mattress? Proper inflation is essential for optimal comfort and support. To inflate a blow-up mattress, use a pump or air compressor that is compatible with the mattress valve. Some air mattresses come with built-in pumps or have pumps that can be purchased separately. Follow the air bed\u2019s specific set of instructions for proper inflation, and do not overinflate the mattress. Overinflation can cause the seams to burst or damage the valve \u2013 which is a recipe for disaster! How Do I Deflate an Air Mattress? To deflate an air mattress, open the valve and allow the air to escape. An air bed usually needs some help to deflate, and doing so can actually be a fun activity. Use your pump to roll out any of the remaining air, or you can use your hands to help press and guide out the air in the mattress. You can even walk on the mattress, stepping the air out towards the valve. After this, fold or roll the mattress for storage. Proper deflation and storage are essential for maintaining the longevity of the mattress. Make sure the mattress is completely deflated before folding or rolling it to avoid damage to the seams or valve. Are Air Mattresses Good to Sleep on? Air mattresses can be a good option for temporary sleeping arrangements or camping trips. Our air bed models at Factory Buys offer comfortable support and durability. Always ensure to follow proper inflation and maintenance guidelines for optimal use and comfort when sleeping. While air mattresses may not provide the same level of comfort as a traditional mattress, they can be a convenient and cost-effective alternative for occasional use. Choose a high-quality model that meets your needs and budget for the best sleeping experience. Where Can I Buy Cheap Air Mattresses?

Portable fire pits for camping and your home Portable fire pits for camping and to make the most of your backyard According to Ancient Greek myths, fire has been with humanity ever since Prometheus stole it from the gods. Thanks, Prometheus! Now, we have ready access to the loveliest source of light in the known universe. And even better, with a portable or fold up camp fire, you can now enjoy that fire while adventuring in the great outdoors. Camping fire pits that everyone will love To be honest, there are lots of bad things about camping. All too often on a camping trip you have to endure bugs, harsh weather, dangerous wildlife, and the sound of children complaining that they don\u2019t have access to the internet. One thing about camping, however, is always tremendous: the campfire. At Factory Buys, we stock a range of fold up fire pits and portable fire pits. And with a portable fire pit, camping is more fun than ever before. A cheap, portable fire pit won\u2019t be too heavy in your swag, and will let you have safe, portable fire almost anywhere. And while fire has many uses, here\u2019s our favourite use for a camping fire pit: BBQ. Don\u2019t limit yourself to basking in the light and heat of the fire; put it to practical use by cooking delicious food. Just because these fire pits are portable, doesn\u2019t mean you have to move them Are these fire pits portable? They certainly are. But just because you can transport a camp fire pit, doesn\u2019t mean you have to do that. When it comes to fire pits, camping is just one of the possible uses. You can also use these camp fire pits in your backyard, to enliven parties and make the night time that much more enjoyable. Getting a collapsible camping fire pit is a great choice, even just for storage in the family home. A big and heavy permanent fire pit might get in the way of a game of backyard cricket. Not so with a folding camping fire pit. Get an affordable Afterpay fire pit At Factory Buys, we sell cheap, portable fire pits. But with a flexible payment plan, these camping fire pits just got that much more affordable. When you buy your portable camping fire pit on Afterpay, repayments will be split into small and manageable chunks.

For example, if you want a luxury bedroom look, you might select a bed with an ornate headboard and matching bedroom suite furniture. Alternatively, if you prefer a more relaxed look, you might select bedroom furniture in natural wood tones. Whichever style you choose, remember that the bedroom is a place for relaxation and rest, so make sure to select bedroom furniture that reflects this. Does Your Bedroom Furniture Have To Match? There is no definitive answer when it comes to bedroom furniture. Some people prefer to have a bedroom suite with matching furniture, while others prefer to mix and match different pieces to create their own unique look. Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when choosing bedroom furniture. First, consider the overall style of the room. If you want a cohesive look, then choosing bedroom furniture that is all the same style will be the best option. However, if you are going for a more eclectic look, then mixing and matching different styles can give your bedroom personality and character. Second, think about functionality. If you need extra storage space, then choosing bedroom furniture with built-in storage will be a good option. Finally, consider your budget. bedroom furniture can be quite expensive, so it is important to set a budget before you start shopping. By keeping these things in mind, you should be able to find bedroom furniture that is perfect for your needs and taste."}, "https://dunlin.com.au/products/beadlight-cirrus": {" Beadlight Cirrus LED Reading Light \u2013 Dunlin Home ": "Beadlight Cirrus LED Reading Light Handmade by Beadlight in the UK, the Cirrus collection was originally designed for use in private jet aircraft, and first and business class cabins.

These types of sofas are designed to be modular, meaning that they can be arranged in different configurations to suit a range of spaces and needs. This flexibility makes modular sofas and corner lounges ideal for small apartments, large homes, and everything in between. Modular couches and sofas are typically made up of individual sections that can be joined together to create a larger seating area. The sections can be arranged in various configurations, such as an L-shape, U-shape, or even a circular shape, depending on the space available and the desired look. Modular sofas can also be easily expanded or downsized by adding or removing sections as needed, making them a versatile option for any space. Corner lounges, on the other hand, are designed to fit snugly into a corner of a room, maximising the available space. They are typically L-shaped and can be left-handed or right-handed, depending on the layout of the room. Corner lounges are great for smaller spaces or open-plan living areas, as they allow for ample seating without taking up too much space. One of the benefits of modular sofas and corner lounges is their flexibility. They can be rearranged to suit different occasions, such as a movie night with friends or a family gathering. For example, a modular sofa can be arranged in a U-shape for a cozy conversation area, or in a long straight line for a more formal setting. Similarly, a corner lounge can be paired with a few armchairs from the same or different range and a coffee table to create a comfortable and functional living area. Another benefit of modular sofas and corner lounges is their ability to accommodate different lifestyles. For example, a family with young children might opt for a corner lounge with chaise, providing a comfortable and safe space for kids to play and relax. Alternatively, an older couple may opt for a 3 seater sofa that can have an ottoman attached to create a more formal living area to entertain guests. In addition to their flexibility, modular sofas and corner lounges also offer a range of design options. They come in a variety of styles, from Scandinavian to modern-contemporary and can be upholstered in a range of fabrics and colours. Overall, modular sofas and corner lounges are a great option for anyone looking for versatile and flexible seating solutions. With their ability to be arranged in various configurations, their ability to accommodate different lifestyles, and their range of design options, modular sofas and corner lounges are a stylish and functional addition to any home. RJ Living has a range of modular sofas and couches, such as the Jam, Seam, Swell, Ondo and Dumpling that are available to be purchased in a variety of fabrics and colours.", "Page temporarily unavailable": "Returns & RefundsRead more Collections -

Does not come with mattress or cover. Mattress and cover can be purchased separately. A Vast Icon, the Samson Daybed is a simple design, beautifully executed. Crafted from solid mango hardwood, and hand finished with 4 coats of hard wearing NC lacquer, this daybed is designed to last for decades. While we sell many of these for inside use, it is also perfectly suited for a covered veranda. The timber used in this piece is sustainably sourced Mango Wood. Each plank is individually treated in a computer controlled kiln to reduce the chance of any cracks or warping in its long future as a furniture component. This piece has been handcrafted by one of our Vast Masters, these individual cabinet makers have been manufacturing Vast products for over a decade. Using traditional joinery techniques to maximise the timber's natural beauty is a big part of the unique look of each Vast product. We call this \"working with the grain\". After the joinery is complete it is then hand sanded and hand polished with several coats of high grade German lacquer so it will last for generations! Country of Origin: India Hardwood is a natural material which reacts to its environment and although our manufacturing process allows for normal expansion and contraction, extreme high or low humidity may cause more swelling than normal. To minimise movement and ensure longevity of your purchase we recommend taking good care of your piece as outlined below: - Dust regularly with a clean cotton cloth; - Use tablecloths, table runners and coasters to help prevent scratches to the surface and wipe up any spills immediately; - To nourish and protect your furniture we recommend waxing with a natural beeswax every 6-12 months. - Only use natural wax, oil or water based cleaning products. Do not use solvent based cleaning products that may contain silicone or alcohol, as this may react and permanently damage the lacquer. - Do not expose to fragrant oils, insect repellent lotion, or nail polish remover as these are often solvent based and will damage the lacquer - Avoid placing your furniture near fireplaces, in direct sunlight or under heating/cooling vents. - Do not leave hot items or ice cold items directly on the surface of the table as water marking may occur. - Any metal work featuring on your product has been powder coated. Any damage to the surface should be contained as soon as possible to prevent rusting. Product Specs Box 1 (top) 220 x 90 x 13cm.

Does not come with mattress or cover. Mattress and cover can be purchased separately. The Bonne Daybed is a simple design, beautifully executed - the smaller version of our iconic Samson Daybed. Crafted from solid mango hardwood, and hand finished with 4 coats of hard wearing NC lacquer, this daybed is designed to last for decades. While we sell many of these for inside use, it is also perfectly suited for your covered veranda. The timber used in this piece is sustainably sourced Mango Wood. Each plank is individually treated in a computer controlled kiln to reduce the chance of any cracks or warping in its long future as a furniture component. This piece has been handcrafted by one of our Vast Masters, these individual cabinet makers have been manufacturing Vast products for over a decade. Using traditional joinery techniques to maximise the timber's natural beauty is a big part of the unique look of each Vast product. We call this \"working with the grain\". After the joinery is complete it is then hand sanded and hand polished with several coats of high grade German lacquer so it will last for generations! Country of Origin: India Hardwood is a natural material which reacts to its environment and although our manufacturing process allows for normal expansion and contraction, extreme high or low humidity may cause more swelling than normal. To minimise movement and ensure longevity of your purchase we recommend taking good care of your piece as outlined below: - Dust regularly with a clean cotton cloth; - Use tablecloths, table runners and coasters to help prevent scratches to the surface and wipe up any spills immediately; - To nourish and protect your furniture we recommend waxing with a natural beeswax every 6-12 months. - Only use natural wax, oil or water based cleaning products. Do not use solvent based cleaning products that may contain silicone or alcohol, as this may react and permanently damage the lacquer. - Do not expose to fragrant oils, insect repellent lotion, or nail polish remover as these are often solvent based and will damage the lacquer - Avoid placing your furniture near fireplaces, in direct sunlight or under heating/cooling vents. - Do not leave hot items or ice cold items directly on the surface of the table as water marking may occur. - Any metal work featuring on your product has been powder coated. Any damage to the surface should be contained as soon as possible to prevent rusting. Product Specs Box 1 (Top): 175 x 90 x 13 cm.

Unfortunately at this time, Four Chairs Furniture does not offer International shipping at this time on any items. COLOR NOTE How can I tell what color the fabric is? Because every monitor displays color differently we cannot be responsible for products appearing differently than expected. If you have questions about your color selections please email us at orders@4-chairs.com or by phone at 801-796-3400 and we'd be happy to assist you. WALLPAPER: How many rolls of wallpaper do I need for my walls? Follow the directions to get a rough estimate of how many single rolls you might need. Always plan on getting more wallpaper than calculated to ensure you have enough. Different pattern repeats often cause waste when matching up the patterns. This should give you an idea of the amount of wallpaper needed. 1. First measure the length of the walls. Add the length of the walls together to calculate the perimeter of the area. 2. Then measure the height of the walls. Multiple the height of the walls by the perimeter to calculate the square feet. 3. A Single Roll of wallpaper usually covers about 31 square feet. Divide the square footage of your area by the number of feet the single roll covers to estimate the number of rolls you will need. *Note: For a better value, most purchase wallpaper in Double Rolls, divide the square footage by the number of square feet in the double roll to find out how many you'll need. CUSTOM FURNITURE: How does custom furniture work? A lot of our furniture is customizable to what you need for your home. We have hundreds of fabrics to choose from and can help you pick the one that works best for your home. Not only can you chose what fabric you want your furniture piece in, but you can also choose the style. Some pieces have the option to add or subtract parts of them. For help deciding what fabric to purchase, you can email orders@4-chairs.com and a design expert will help you out.", " RETURN POLICY \u2013 Four Chairs Furniture and Design ": "RETURN POLICY 150 SOUTH STATE STREET LINDON, UT 84042 GENERAL RETURNS Four Chairs Furniture & Design will not accept online returns after 14 days of delivery for any reason.

Here are some basic tips when shopping for lounge chairs: - Even the most famous pieces, such as the Barcelona chair, Eames chair or Marshmallow sofa come in a range of colors and fabrics.Be sure to ask for the color and fabric options before you order. - While most modern lounge chairs, chaise lounges,leather office chairs and bedroom chaise lounge chairs go well with one another,you may want to go with designs from a specific designer, too, such as Le Corbusier or Eileen Gray. - Many pieces are interchangeable in the spaces you have available. For example, a Bedroom Chaise Lounge may also work well in a living room as a lounge chair or chaise lounge. Function over form is the mantra here.Often you can disregard the category assigned to an actual piece of furniture you like and go with your instincts. When selecting lounge chairs and other seating for your home,experiment with shapes as well as textures and colors.The crisp design of modern chaise lounges and other furnishings encourages exploration of new ideas in interior design.", " Modern Coffee Tables | Coffee Tables | Round Coffee Tables | Square Coffee Tables - Fire Collection": "Modern coffee tables, round coffee tables and square coffee tables If it weren't for the popularity of tea, coffee tables would have never found their way into modern homes. At the height of the tea-drinking craze in Britain, a new low table where Brits could put their cups came into being. The tea table became the modern coffee table during the Arts and Crafts movement. Next time you play trivia you can thank designer E.W. Godwin for the fact that we don't have \"tea table books\" on our tea tables and can instead enjoy the low slung, versatile coffee table we've come to love today. Coffee Table tips: Since the very beginning of the Modernist movement, designers have been particularly drawn to the coffee table and end table as a place to experiment with new designs and materials. Here are some helpful tips so you can make the most of your coffee tables: - The Glass Coffee Table is a classic in modern furniture. Most glass coffee tables have tempered glass to prevent breakage and add strength. But if it's not specifically mentioned, be sure to ask. - When shopping for a round coffee table, square coffee table or oval coffee table, consider the furnishings that will surround it. Visually these are all grouped together and should complement one another. - If you like a piece that is as much a work of art as a coffee table or end table, consider a signature creation from one of the great modern designers such as van der Rohe, Gray or the Eames brothers. When it comes to coffee tables don't be shy about making a statement with the design. Modern furniture is not only functional, but fun as well.", " Modern Ottomans | Leather Ottoman | Fabric Ottoman | Foot Stool - Fire Collection": "1 View All Before the foot stool appeared in European homes in the early 1800s, who knows where people used to put their feet. Thankfully, the foot stool gained a foot hold in homes rapidly and morphed into the ottoman we know today. The modern ottoman and leather ottoman, along with fabric ottoman chairs, not only provide visitors and family members with an upholstered seat where they can rest their weary feet, but also offer additional seating during a party or holiday gathering. Also known as a tuffet (now you know what Little Miss Muffett was sitting on), the ottoman bench offers homeowners many choices in arranging the furnishings in their home.
