Please create a seperate order for each pre-order product type. We just need a 20% deposit to secure your items.\nNote: This is a frame only. Does not come with mattress or cover. Mattress and cover can be purchased separately.\nA Vast Icon, the Samson Daybed is a simple design, beautifully executed.\nCrafted from solid mango hardwood, and hand finished with 4 coats of hard wearing NC lacquer, this daybed is designed to last for decades. While we sell many of these for inside use, it is also perfectly suited for a covered veranda.\nThe timber used in this piece is sustainably sourced Mango Wood. Each plank is individually treated in a computer controlled kiln to reduce the chance of any cracks or warping in its long future as a furniture component.\nThis piece has been handcrafted by one of our Vast Masters, these individual cabinet makers have been manufacturing Vast products for over a decade. Using traditional joinery techniques to maximise the timber's natural beauty is a big part of the unique look of each Vast product. We call this \"working with the grain\". After the joinery is complete it is then hand sanded and hand polished with several coats of high grade German lacquer so it will last for generations!\nCountry of Origin: India\nHardwood is a natural material which reacts to its environment and although our manufacturing process allows for normal expansion and contraction, extreme high or low humidity may cause more swelling than normal. To minimise movement and ensure longevity of your purchase we recommend taking good care of your piece as outlined below:\n- Dust regularly with a clean cotton cloth;\n- Use tablecloths, table runners and coasters to help prevent scratches to the surface and wipe up any spills immediately;\n- To nourish and protect your furniture we recommend waxing with a natural beeswax every 6-12 months.\n- Only use natural wax, oil or water based cleaning products. Do not use solvent based cleaning products that may contain silicone or alcohol, as this may react and permanently damage the lacquer.\n- Do not expose to fragrant oils, insect repellent lotion, or nail polish remover as these are often solvent based and will damage the lacquer\n- Avoid placing your furniture near fireplaces, in direct sunlight or under heating/cooling vents.\n- Do not leave hot items or ice cold items directly on the surface of the table as water marking may occur.\n- Any metal work featuring on your product has been powder coated. Any damage to the surface should be contained as soon as possible to prevent rusting.\nProduct Specs\nBox 1 (top) 220 x 90 x 13cm.

For us to send the gift card directly to your recipient with a personal note, please add the email address and personal note at check out in the \"note for order\" section.\nAny questions please contact us.\nLead Times May Apply - Stock Availability:\nAs we are an online only store we hold our homewares and smaller furniture items at our warehouse in Perth. The majority of our larger furniture items are delivered directly from our amazing brand partners. We work very closely with them to understand stock availability, but we also don\u2019t like to disappoint our customers if it is out of stock or if there is a lead time as stock levels change frequently. Therefore if an item has a \"lead times may apply' message this means they may be in stock or have a lead time of 4 - 12 weeks, it just means we need to double check stock availability as they are super popular. Feel free however to place an order now as we also guarantee a full refund (within the week of purchase), if we contact you to advise the item is out of stock and/or lead times are longer than expected.\nPre-Orders:\nWe do however highly recommend placing a pre-order as items can sell out prior to shipments arriving, and this will ensure you receive your piece in the next shipment. If you would like estimated lead times, shipping quotes or any other information please try the instant chat or click on the Get In Touch button and we will get back to you as soon as possible. We can arrange a 50% deposit for all pre-order items, with balance due prior to delivery.\nLead Times:\nCranmore Home & Co quote an approximate lead time for the receipt of any orders based on information provided by their partner suppliers at time of purchase. Circumstances beyond our control, may cause disruptions and lead to a delay in your order being delivered on quoted lead times once an order is placed. We will keep you as up to date as possible on any changes to estimated lead times.\nDelivery:\nWhat we can promise is that we will ship all in-stock products from our Perth warehouse within 3 business days and in the case of bespoke or out-of-stock products, customers will be emailed as soon as possible with an estimated shipping date. As we are an online business and many of our larger items are delivered directly from our suppliers, in this case we endeavour to ensure that our suppliers dispatch in-stock items within 5-10 business days. Delivery all depends on where it is coming from and where you live. We generally allow 7-14 days most metro areas and for many country locations, WA, NT & Tasmania please allow 2-3 weeks. Some of our items are available for collection from our Perth warehouse and will have this information on the product page if available.\nNOTE: For pre-orders from suppliers with stock coming from international manufacturers please keep in mind, the current worldwide increase in demand and restrictions for international ocean freight container exports. This is affecting supply chains extensively and sometimes lead time extensions are out of our control.\nShipping:\nAll items have a flat fee based on weight, dimensions and delivery location. This cost ranges from $9.95 - $250 for metro areas throughout Australia and this will be applied at checkout if required. For regional areas throughout Australia or for some super heavy/bulky/fragile items you may incur an additional fee, this will be advised after checkout, prior to dispatch if required. If you would like a quote tailored for your order prior to check out please contact us . Some of our items are available for collection from our Perth warehouse and will have this information on the product page if available. Orders over $2500 are eligible for free shipping to metro cities (exc TAS & NT). For all orders over $2500 that fall within regional postcodes they will incur an additional delivery charge invoiced after order. Please contact us for a quote prior to order if you would like this confirmed.\nPLEASE NOTE: Delivery is to your post box or front door only. If you require white glove service of delivery, placement of item and removal of packaging please contact us to arrange.

This makes it hard wearing, highly resistant to rotting and almost impervious to the effects of sun, rain, frost or snow. These characteristics combine to make it the ideal timber for all outdoor applications. Only premium grade plantation-grown teak is used for the manufacture of Gloster furniture. The features of premium grade teak are a straight grain structure, the absence of knots, splits or cracks and an even overall colour.\nINDOOR USE\nGloster buffed teak benefits from an enhanced surface preparation procedure, where the natural oils already contained within the teak are brought to the surface and burnished to produce a rich sheen and a consistent colour. If you intend to use your furniture indoors or under cover outside (where it will not get wet), the teak will retain much of its original colour and the soft sheen of its buffed finish. Any marks, stains or damage to the buffed teak finish can be restored using the Gloster Buffed Teak Repair Kit.\nOUTDOOR USE\nGloster buffed teak benefits from an enhanced surface preparation procedure, where the natural oils already contained within the teak are brought to the surface and burnished to produce a rich sheen and a consistent colour.\nAs with natural finish teak, left to age naturally outside, buffed teak will gradually change to a soft, silver-grey as the pigments in the surface layer of the wood begin to fade away. After the first few exposures to water, you should also expect the surface grain to rise slightly. As a part of the buffing process, the surface is wetted before final sanding to raise the grain, so there will be significantly less raised grain on buffed teak than on natural finish teak. We recommend that you allow your teak furniture to weather naturally this way and simply clean thoroughly once or twice a year with our Teak Cleaner. Buffed teak furniture may also benefit from an occasional light sanding to remove any raised grain and restore a smooth finish to the surface. Under no circumstances should a power washer be used to clean teak furniture as this will erode the surface.\nBecause teak is a naturally oily wood, it is not possible to paint or varnish. Any paint or varnish applied will not adhere properly to the surface and after a short while will start to peel off.\nIf you wish to retain the golden-brown colour of new teak we also offer a Teak Sealer. Application of Teak Sealer will not affect the strength or longevity of the furniture in any way, just its appearance. If you elect to use Teak Sealer you will be embarking on a regular maintenance programme as Teak Sealer needs to be regularly re-applied to provide continuous protection.\nIf you intend to store your furniture over the winter, we recommend that you do so in a water-tight garden shed or garage. However, we advise that you do not move teak furniture from the garden straight into a heated indoor room for storage, as the sharp differences in temperature and humidity may cause the wood to split.\nTo protect teak surfaces from staining and to help maintain the silver-grey patina on weathered teak, we recommend using our Teak Protector. Our Teak Protector creates an almost invisible shield which helps to prevent food (coffee, ketchup, red wine, olive oil, etc.) penetrating into the teak and causing unsightly stains. Teak Protector also helps protects the wood against the ingress of moisture, the adhesion of dirt and prevents mildew growth."}, "https://thebrick.com/products/tacoma-chest": {"404 Not Found | The Brick": null}, "https://capsulehome.com/products/frey-sofa'%3EFrey%20Sofa%3C/a%3E%20and%20I%20wanted%20to%20share%20it%20with%20you": {"\n    Capsule Home \u2013 Opening Soon\n  ": "Unfortunately, we are no longer in operation and have to say good bye.

Avoid using abrasive cleanser that may scratch the plastic. Use a tub/tile/sink cleaner; non-abrasive, all-purpose cleaner; or a paste of baking soda and water. Apply the cleaner to the surface or on a damp sponge and rub gently. The plastic injection moulding process produces large numbers of parts of high quality with great accuracy, very quickly. Plastic material in the form of granules is melted until soft enough to be injected under pressure to fill a mould. The result is that the shape is exactly copied.

Pony has a moulded foam body, feet and ears which are all connected by a tube frame and upholstered in a stretch fabric. Pony chair was designed in 1973 by Eero Aarnio.\nWe are happy to provide you fabric samples to help you decide the perfect colour for your Pony. You can find our contact information here.\nDimensions: 110 cm width x 65 cm depth x 87 cm height\nMaterials: Metal, moulded foam, fabric\nWeight: 5.0 kg\n\u201cA chair is a chair, is a chair, is a chair... but a seat does not necessarily have to be a chair. It can be anything as long as it is ergonomically correct. A seat could even be a small and soft Pony on which you can ride or sit sideways. Pony looks like a child\u2019s oversized toy, but its dimensions are suited to adults. We are all big kids, of course.\u201d\nIn 1972 the Aarnios lived in Tontunm\u00e4ki, where Eero utilized their garage as his work space. Although his previous pieces had already possessed uniqueness and characteristics, Eero describes Pony as his first very unusual design. He thought about chairs. One can sit almost anywhere. A seat doesn\u2019t even have to be a chair or a sofa. One can sit on the stairs, on a rock, on a tree stump, on a horse, on a pony\u2026 He decided to design a soft animal figure, which you could sit on, like riding a horse.\nIn 1973 the first sketch of the Pony was sent to Asko Furniture company, who was the main producer of Eero Aarnio\u2019s designs. They completed the basic form for the seat and sent it by bus to Puumala, where Eero continued developing the prototype at the Aarnio family\u2019s summer cottage. Eero thought the first mold was decent but needed enhancing. In the country side, there was plenty of space to work, and since the body was made of polystyrene, he didn\u2019t mind getting his hands and surroundings all over it. Eero bought some modeling clay and worked further with the body. After the basic form was finished, he painted the first Pony white.\nFrom the start Eero knew the Pony needed upholstering. The process for the upholsterer is extremely challenging and difficult, requiring rare talent in hand crafting. As a result, one can only admire the magnificent seaming, intertwining together with the form of the body and flexibility of the fabric. However, some Ponys out there do not have their \u2018furs\u2019. Batches has been produced of concrete to serve as road blocks. Ponys made of concrete are not easily moved around, since they weigh as much as 250kg.\nEero Aarnio\u2019s Pony is no regular chair. The designer himself prefers to rather call it a seat. Eero designed the Pony first and foremost to provide a comfortable form. The size came out of ergonomics, it is the perfect height for back and feet to rest. One can ride it or sit sideways on it. Eero initially designed the smaller size for children, however, the young have always been as keen on to climb on the larger Pony. It looks like a child\u2019s oversized toy, even though the dimensions are designed for adults. \u201cWe are all big kids, of course\u201d, says Eero Aarnio.\nPony is often referred to as intriguing the inner child in adults. Eero\u2019s design aesthetics have a certain playfulness and humor, which have been very salient in his creativity and thinking process. Eero believes certain pieces should have a certain personality, one that suits them perfectly. For example, color is a key part of the message and a way of communicating for Eero. For the Pony, Eero prefers the colors green and white. Although, speaking from experience, for a family with children, white can be quite sensitive\u2026"}, "https://chansfurniture.com/products/copy-of-42-tennant-brand-modern-style-beatrice-bathroom-sink-vanity-tb-9433-v42-wenge-color": {"42\" Tennant Brand Beatrice Navy Blue Modern Bathroom Sink Vanity TB-94 \u2013 Chans Furniture\n": "Description\nDimensions: 42 in.

Some are right here in Phoenix, AZ, while others are in California, or the midwest like Illinois or Indiana. Many of our domestic items are made-to-order and are built when the order is placed, so their production time is a little longer than others. We also offer a selection of items that are imported, so they often have quicker production times since those items are already made.\nSince lead times can vary, we give an estimated range. These lead times are APPROXIMATE, they are NOT EXACT. Items may arrive early or unexpected delays can occur with builders and/or shippers. These situations are beyond our control. By placing an order, the customer agrees that they understand the production time is our best estimate. When the order is ready for In-Store Pick Up or Local Delivery, you will receive a call to schedule it.\nCurrent estimated lead time is per builder item # prefix.\nFor example, item FD-3051T has an \"FD-\" at the beginning of its item #. On our list below, FD- items have a lead time of 8 - 12 weeks. So item FD-3051T has a lead time of 8 - 12 weeks. Please remember this is an ESTIMATE and many factors can affect it.\nIf your delivery location is outside of Arizona please add at least 2 weeks extra to these estimates to allow for the shipper's scheduling and routing delivery arrangements.

The archetypal unibody section that functions as both back and arm rest is a Danish archetype that dates back more than 200 years and was first inspired by furniture from ancient Greece.\nHarmony in steel and wood\nSpecial attention has been given to the balance of materials in Arc Chair\u2019s design.

Each curve and form has been carefully created by hand in the metal and wood workshops of TAKT and Depping & J\u00f8rgensen. During production, the sensibility of the design has been translated to modern robotic machinery that is reviewed and operated by skilled craftsmen. The result is a precisely crafted piece of design that benefits from modern machinery while retaining human sensibility.\nThe woodwork\nArc chair has two wood options available: Beech and Oak, each of which has a different aesthetic effect. Beech wood is sturdy and durable yet relatively flexible. Its widespread use is a testament to its unpretentious and approachable nature. The Oak version is more rustic in appearance. The surface is treated with natural oils.

Arc Dining Table by Depping & Jorgensen is an elegant and highly versatile addition to the household. It gives TAKT customers the opportunity to acquire the versatility and functionality of an extendable table at a price point they might expect of a fixed-size one.\nDesigned in response to changing needs\nArc Dining Table has been designed in response to the changing needs of the modern family home, in which the dining table serves as not just a place to eat, but as the social hub of the house, where all generations come together to work, dine, talk, play and connect. With the function of a dining table today often dictated by who needs to use it and when \u2013 from kids doing homework after school to big weekend meals with extra guests.\nA sense of balance\nArc Dining Table is available with a fixed-size tabletop or with extension lengths of 158 to 250 cm, allowing the user to transform the table as the situation \u2013 and guest list \u2013 demands. Typically, extendable dining tables compromise their aesthetic integrity when extended. Arc Dining Table, in contrast, has been designed with the focus on maintaining a clear design expression at all sizes. Proportions have been carefully considered to achieve a sense of balance; the legs\u2019 considered position in each rounded corner makes transforming the table simple and intuitive, via an extension mechanism concealed by the oak stretchers.\nProduct specifications\nWhat our customers say\nPersonal service\nWe went to the showroom on S\u00f8lvgade and met your friendly staff.\n\u2013 Fredrik, May 2022\nSustainability in focus\nThe story behind, and sustainable production, and the feeling of no risk with the free return information.\n\u2013 Gloria, April 2022\nGood experience\nThe design is original, of good quality and sustainable, and the delivery was very quick.

I am a furniture designer myself, and your product makes me happy.\n\u2013 Simon, January 2022\nSlow craft meets modern tech\nCecilie Manz\u2019s ingenious solution reduces the entire furniture to just two components: tabletop and apron. The top and side pieces are cut from a single, flawless piece of wood, which is handselected and cut precisely from timber logs to create the desired surface texture and grain. The finished planks are then machined to ensure the highest possible degree of precision before the leather components are fixed into place. This allows it to be shipped in a narrow, completely flat package, and to be delightfully assembled with ease: no need for glue, bolts or screws.\nConscious vegetable tanning\nPlint is made using high-quality hides produced using a chrome-free tanning process. The leather is sourced from the small Swedish tannery T\u00e4rnsj\u00f6 Garveri, one of the few tanning houses which still practises environmentally conscious vegetable tanning (using bark extracts) as opposed to the time-efficient but more polluting chrome-based technique popular with many furniture manufacturers. The top of the furniture is attached to the legs with leather hinges. The apron is fitted with a leather loop that is fed through an aperture in the supports and fixed in place with an octagonal wedge. The wedge connection \u2013 a mechanism reminiscent of the \u2018pegged stretcher\u2019 joinery method sometimes found in traditional dining tables \u2013 is finely crafted to ensure the connection is secure and the assembled structure is stable and robust.\nProduct specifications\nPraise from the press\nAll pieces have been awarded the EU Ecolabel, which vouches not only for the sustainability of the materials used, but also for the consideration of the environmental impact a product has in its lifetime.\nThe Cross Chair is quickly becoming a contemporary classic.

Oregon Pine has a precise and regular grain structure and a warm golden glow. Slow-grown Kalmar Pine from Swedish forests has a soft, bright look and a beautiful grain pattern. The Oak version is darker, and more rustic in appearance. The surface is treated with natural white-pigmented oil. This treatment allows the wood to develop a characterful patina over time, and will also enable you to easily repair damage to the surface by applying light sandpaper and a new oil treatment \u2013 again and again.\nSustainability\nPlint is designed through TAKT\u2019s Eco System Design principles and are shipped component based as flat packs.

Our Perpetual Sustainable Design philosophy ensures that all our furniture is designed for repair so that you can replace or recycle components later in life.\nMake it yours\nSpoke Sofa can also be customised with a variety of Gabriel fabrics, ensuring that your sofa seamlessly blends in with your personal interior style.

This remarkable feature ensures that your seating experience remains consistently comfortable, regardless of how frequently you indulge in moments of relaxation.\nIn addition to the exceptional cushioning, Spoke Sofas also offer movable armrests.
