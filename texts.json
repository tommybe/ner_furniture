Mattress and cover can be purchased separately.\nA Vast Icon, the Samson Daybed is a simple design, beautifully executed.\nCrafted from solid mango hardwood, and hand finished with 4 coats of hard wearing NC lacquer, this daybed is designed to last for decades. While we sell many of these for inside use, it is also perfectly suited for a covered veranda.\nThe timber used in this piece is sustainably sourced Mango Wood. Each plank is individually treated in a computer controlled kiln to reduce the chance of any cracks or warping in its long future as a furniture component.\nThis piece has been handcrafted by one of our Vast Masters, these individual cabinet makers have been manufacturing Vast products for over a decade. Using traditional joinery techniques to maximise the timber's natural beauty is a big part of the unique look of each Vast product. We call this \"working with the grain\". After the joinery is complete it is then hand sanded and hand polished with several coats of high grade German lacquer so it will last for generations!\nCountry of Origin: India\nHardwood is a natural material which reacts to its environment and although our manufacturing process allows for normal expansion and contraction, extreme high or low humidity may cause more swelling than normal. To minimise movement and ensure longevity of your purchase we recommend taking good care of your piece as outlined below:\n- Dust regularly with a clean cotton cloth;\n- Use tablecloths, table runners and coasters to help prevent scratches to the surface and wipe up any spills immediately;\n- To nourish and protect your furniture we recommend waxing with a natural beeswax every 6-12 months.\n- Only use natural wax, oil or water based cleaning products. Do not use solvent based cleaning products that may contain silicone or alcohol, as this may react and permanently damage the lacquer.\n- Do not expose to fragrant oils, insect repellent lotion, or nail polish remover as these are often solvent based and will damage the lacquer\n- Avoid placing your furniture near fireplaces, in direct sunlight or under heating/cooling vents.\n- Do not leave hot items or ice cold items directly on the surface of the table as water marking may occur.\n- Any metal work featuring on your product has been powder coated. Any damage to the surface should be contained as soon as possible to prevent rusting.\nProduct Specs\nBox 1 (top) 220 x 90 x 13cm.

The majority of our larger furniture items are delivered directly from our amazing brand partners. We work very closely with them to understand stock availability, but we also don\u2019t like to disappoint our customers if it is out of stock or if there is a lead time as stock levels change frequently. Therefore if an item has a \"lead times may apply' message this means they may be in stock or have a lead time of 4 - 12 weeks, it just means we need to double check stock availability as they are super popular. Feel free however to place an order now as we also guarantee a full refund (within the week of purchase), if we contact you to advise the item is out of stock and/or lead times are longer than expected.\nPre-Orders:\nWe do however highly recommend placing a pre-order as items can sell out prior to shipments arriving, and this will ensure you receive your piece in the next shipment.

Circumstances beyond our control, may cause disruptions and lead to a delay in your order being delivered on quoted lead times once an order is placed. We will keep you as up to date as possible on any changes to estimated lead times.\nDelivery:\nWhat we can promise is that we will ship all in-stock products from our Perth warehouse within 3 business days and in the case of bespoke or out-of-stock products, customers will be emailed as soon as possible with an estimated shipping date. As we are an online business and many of our larger items are delivered directly from our suppliers, in this case we endeavour to ensure that our suppliers dispatch in-stock items within 5-10 business days.

Some of our items are available for collection from our Perth warehouse and will have this information on the product page if available.\nNOTE: For pre-orders from suppliers with stock coming from international manufacturers please keep in mind, the current worldwide increase in demand and restrictions for international ocean freight container exports. This is affecting supply chains extensively and sometimes lead time extensions are out of our control.\nShipping:\nAll items have a flat fee based on weight, dimensions and delivery location. This cost ranges from $9.95 - $250 for metro areas throughout Australia and this will be applied at checkout if required. For regional areas throughout Australia or for some super heavy/bulky/fragile items you may incur an additional fee, this will be advised after checkout, prior to dispatch if required.

These characteristics combine to make it the ideal timber for all outdoor applications. Only premium grade plantation-grown teak is used for the manufacture of Gloster furniture. The features of premium grade teak are a straight grain structure, the absence of knots, splits or cracks and an even overall colour.\nINDOOR USE\nGloster buffed teak benefits from an enhanced surface preparation procedure, where the natural oils already contained within the teak are brought to the surface and burnished to produce a rich sheen and a consistent colour. If you intend to use your furniture indoors or under cover outside (where it will not get wet), the teak will retain much of its original colour and the soft sheen of its buffed finish. Any marks, stains or damage to the buffed teak finish can be restored using the Gloster Buffed Teak Repair Kit.\nOUTDOOR USE\nGloster buffed teak benefits from an enhanced surface preparation procedure, where the natural oils already contained within the teak are brought to the surface and burnished to produce a rich sheen and a consistent colour.\nAs with natural finish teak, left to age naturally outside, buffed teak will gradually change to a soft, silver-grey as the pigments in the surface layer of the wood begin to fade away. After the first few exposures to water, you should also expect the surface grain to rise slightly. As a part of the buffing process, the surface is wetted before final sanding to raise the grain, so there will be significantly less raised grain on buffed teak than on natural finish teak. We recommend that you allow your teak furniture to weather naturally this way and simply clean thoroughly once or twice a year with our Teak Cleaner. Buffed teak furniture may also benefit from an occasional light sanding to remove any raised grain and restore a smooth finish to the surface. Under no circumstances should a power washer be used to clean teak furniture as this will erode the surface.\nBecause teak is a naturally oily wood, it is not possible to paint or varnish. Any paint or varnish applied will not adhere properly to the surface and after a short while will start to peel off.\nIf you wish to retain the golden-brown colour of new teak we also offer a Teak Sealer. Application of Teak Sealer will not affect the strength or longevity of the furniture in any way, just its appearance. If you elect to use Teak Sealer you will be embarking on a regular maintenance programme as Teak Sealer needs to be regularly re-applied to provide continuous protection.\nIf you intend to store your furniture over the winter, we recommend that you do so in a water-tight garden shed or garage. However, we advise that you do not move teak furniture from the garden straight into a heated indoor room for storage, as the sharp differences in temperature and humidity may cause the wood to split.\nTo protect teak surfaces from staining and to help maintain the silver-grey patina on weathered teak, we recommend using our Teak Protector. Our Teak Protector creates an almost invisible shield which helps to prevent food (coffee, ketchup, red wine, olive oil, etc.) penetrating into the teak and causing unsightly stains. Teak Protector also helps protects the wood against the ingress of moisture, the adhesion of dirt and prevents mildew growth.", "404 Not Found | The Brick": null, "\n    Capsule Home \u2013 Opening Soon\n  ": "Unfortunately, we are no longer in operation and have to say good bye.

We will not be liable at all for any loss or damage as a result of a late delivery of your order with us.\n-\nInlay Handmade Pieces\nAs with all things made by hand, these pieces are all unique and small flaws may be present, which adds to the intrinsic character and beauty of each piece.\nCare Instructions\nTo clean your bone inlay or mother of pearl inlay furniture, please wipe with a slightly damp cloth. After some time of owning your inlay piece, if the shine comes off slightly then please apply a small amount of coconut oil and white wax and clean it with a dry cloth.\nBone and mother of pearl inlay furniture has a porous surface, so items in high-use situations - such as coffee tables - should be sealed prior to use. Grout or polyurethane sealant (available from any hardware store) is suitable for this - example: https://www.bunnings.com.au/cabot-s-500ml-satin-water-based-cabothane-clear-polyurethane-varnish_p1522368\nWhilst this sealant is clear, when you are sealing your piece, we recommend using a very soft cloth in a circular motion (rather than a paint brush) in order to avoid any potential brush strokes left on your piece.\nPlease do not use regular cleaning products (surface cleaners, glass cleaners) to care for bone inlay. They are very harsh to use on inlay pieces.\nIf your piece is under direct and constant sunlight, the bone pieces may have the potential to turn a slightly yellow tone over time, and little exposure to sunlight can be useful to help them stay light for a longer duration. Please be careful that you don't put your inlay piece under extreme heat or directly under the sun.\nIf your inlay products may be used often (tray, drawers for example), the bone pieces may fall from edges during the use. The wood and bone both are naturally contracting and expanding materials but not at the same pace, so during season/weather change this could happen. Please use all-fix or super glue available locally to easily fix yourself if this may happen.\nFor our vase products, we would recommend covering your vase base prior to using, as these vases are not 100% waterproof.\nUnpacking\nInlay products are delicately handmade and heavy in weight, which is why our products are very carefully bubble wrapped and then packaged and bolted carefully within a crate. During the transit and customs process, our products can be moved around numerous times, and hence it is safe to package with extra precaution to eliminate any damage.\nWhen the larger furniture crate arrives at your home, you will require two tools to open the crate. This includes a crow bar and hammer, or as a third additional option you can use a cordless drill with Phillips head attachment (or a Phillips head screwdriver to unscrew the screws is a perfectly fine alternative). Here is a video displaying a simple way to open your crate: https://youtu.be/c_73cP5dFWM", "Gift Card\n\u2013 Copper Barn Home\n": "Gift Card\nGift Card\nRegular price$1000 $10.00\n/\n- Delivery to select states\n- Secure payments\n- In stock, ready to ship\n- Inventory on the way\nFall Sale Surprise!

Regular vacuuming is recommended without the use of beater bars to avoid threads being pulled. Spills should be absorbed with a dry cloth, then spot cleaned with mild soap and water. It\u2019s normal for loose ends to show up from time to time with any area rug, however it\u2019s important to snip them with a scissor immediately - pulling on loose ends by hand is harmful to the strength of your rug. Rug tolerances can vary by +/- 3 inches in relation to the advertised size. A non-skid pad is recommended to prevent slippage. Since rugs are rolled for shipping, occasionally they may crease during transit. All creases will disappear within 2 weeks after the rug is laid out flat. Reverse rolling will help flatten out creases promptly.\nCollection: Jasmine\nDesign: JAS-200A\nStyle: Modern & Abstract\nPattern: Wavy\nColors: Gray/Black/Ivory/Cream\nConstruction: Machine Woven\nMaterial: 100% Polypropylene\nBacking: Plain\nPile Type: Medium\nPile Height: 0.45\"\nUse: Indoor\nOrigin: Turkey", "\n    Hamptons Style Gift Card\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n  ": "Shopping for someone else but not sure what to give them?

A dependable character of the highest sorts, the namesake of the Bertha chair is Bertha Wilson. The name came out of a conversation that the designer, Donna Wilson, had with Zita Cobb, founder of our parent charity, Shorefast. \u201cWhen she found out that I was Scottish and my last name was Wilson, she shared a story about the only other Scottish woman whom she had ever met who went by the name of Wilson \u2013 Bertha Wilson. A woman of modest means, she became the first female appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada. It seemed like a fitting name for such a humble and modern chair.\u201d\nThe Bertha Chair is inspired by the vintage barrel chairs that were constructed from unused flour barrels. These chairs embody the outport attitude of finding new life for discarded or unused materials. Pair the Bertha Chair with a Pouffe to kick back and enjoy the view.\nMade using regionally sourced birch by our craftspeople at Fogo Island Workshops. Available in a range of finishes including hand-buffed Danish Oil, which deepens the amber colour of the wood, and White Oil, which neutralizes the amber tone for a raw matte look. Both absorb into the wood and richen the grain. A variety of coloured lacquers are available. Custom colours and sizing are available on request.\nThe cushions and matching pouffe can be upholstered in either Kvadrat Divina upholstery or the iconic Shingle-Shangle pattern, inspired by the hand-carved shingles on historic Brett House in Joe Batt\u2019s Arm. Both are 100% wool that is ethically and sustainably sourced, naturally stain resistant, and comes with life-long durability rating of 45,000 Martindale rub tests.\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
