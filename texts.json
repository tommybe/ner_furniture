Originally conceived by Swedish based South Korean designer Jay Design in 2012, this beautiful ethereal piece seems to defy the law of gravity. The Chieut has attracted the praise of leading architectural luminaries such as the Zaha Hadid Architects and was the recipient of the prestigious Golden A' Design Award in 2017. The Chieut table is entirely handcrafted in Italy by design atelier Minimaproject with the finest materials in a limited edition of 200 pieces to guarantee the uniqueness of each piece. Both body and legs can be ordered in a number of powder coating colour finishes to obtain interesting cromatic combinations. Small imperfections might be present-evidence that our pieces are unique and not mass produced.

Its linear, pared-back design and mid-century hairpin legs bring a clean, contemporary Scandinavian aesthetic to your space. We make this design from a selection of beautiful hardwoods including solid European oak, dark stained ash, iroko or walnut. We've given you two widths to choose from so you can choose the size that fits your space best. The openings at either end are closed at the back with a back panel which has a cutout hole for cables, but the central opening is open front and back. The version shown in the images is 180cm wide in oak. This design is made to order and will be ready to ship in about 7-8 weeks. Shipping is free to most UK mainland addresses. For international shipping details click here. Most furniture takes around 6-8 weeks to be ready to send. We will contact you when it's ready so that we can arrange a convenient delivery day. Large items will be delivered using a courier service who can bring it in to a room of choice. Very large, heavy items will be delivered by a 2-person courier team if this service is available to your postcode. Courier delivery unfortunately isn't available to Northern Ireland, some remote postcodes in Wales, Scotland and England or any offshore addresses. For areas not covered by our courier we can package your order on a pallet and ship it with a parcel service. This will incur a surcharge starting at \u00a340 for smaller furniture items. This will be automatically calculated at checkout for Northern Ireland. Please call or send us a message here if you want to discuss delivery options to your postcode. Furniture items are delivered in separate easy to assemble sections with the legs detached. Usually assembly simply involves fitting the legs and connecting the upper and lower sections together with a few bolts (if your design has multiple wooden sections). We supply all bolts and tools needed and it only takes a few minutes. We can also arrange assembly and removal of packaging using a white glove service that will do all the heavy lifting for you. This usually costs \u00a335. Please remember to provide a contact telephone number at checkout. All couriers require this and without it, we can't send your furniture! The shipping cost depends on your country and the size of your order. To see the shipping cost add a product to your cart and then use the shipping calculator at the bottom of the Cart page. You can remove it from your Cart at any time. Europe (EU): we ship with duty and taxes payable by us, not by you, so you won't pay any more to import our furniture into your country. We will handle all the paperwork at our end so it's as easy and hassle free for you as possible. You just pay the shipping costs added at checkout. USA: there is no duty or tax to pay, just the shipping costs added at checkout. Europe (non-EU): you will need to pay import duty and taxes but the shipping cost will be free at checkout. Canada/Australia/Others: shipping will be added at checkout, or contact us to get a shipping quote, you will also have to pay any duties, fees or taxes which are applicable for customs imports into your country. If shipping isn't showing as available to your location don't worry, we can still send it, but we'll need to do a custom quote. Just message us with the product/size you're looking for and we'll get back to you with a price. Items will be sent with an international delivery company (usually UPS, TNT/Fedex or DHL). Unfortunately we can't arrange delivery on a specific day but we will send tracking details as soon as it has been dispatched. You will then be able to contact the delivery company to schedule/reschedule delivery. Delivery takes 3-10 days from the day of dispatch depending on your location and custom clearance times. Delivery is to the street door, so ensure you have someone available to help if you are ordering a large, heavy item. Furniture items are delivered in separate easy to assemble sections with the legs detached. Usually assembly simply involves fitting the legs and connecting the upper and lower sections together with a few bolts (if your design has multiple stacked wooden sections).

This is particularly true of their signature lounge chairs, chaise lounges, Bedroom Chaise Lounges and office chairs that grace our collection of modern seating options. When it comes to the very best in lounge chairs, chaise lounges and office chairs, look no further than LOUNGE CHAIRS AND CHAISE LONGUES In stark contrast to traditional furnishings, modern lounge chairs, chaise lounges, Bedroom Chaise Lounges and office chairs come in an almost endless array of innovative designs and styles. Here are some basic tips when shopping for lounge chairs: - Even the most famous pieces, such as the Barcelona chair, Eames chair or Marshmallow sofa come in a range of colors and fabrics.Be sure to ask for the color and fabric options before you order. - While most modern lounge chairs, chaise lounges,leather office chairs and bedroom chaise lounge chairs go well with one another,you may want to go with designs from a specific designer, too, such as Le Corbusier or Eileen Gray. - Many pieces are interchangeable in the spaces you have available. For example, a Bedroom Chaise Lounge may also work well in a living room as a lounge chair or chaise lounge. Function over form is the mantra here.Often you can disregard the category assigned to an actual piece of furniture you like and go with your instincts. When selecting lounge chairs and other seating for your home,experiment with shapes as well as textures and colors.The crisp design of modern chaise lounges and other furnishings encourages exploration of new ideas in interior design.", " Modern Coffee Tables | Coffee Tables | Round Coffee Tables | Square Coffee Tables - Fire Collection": "Modern coffee tables, round coffee tables and square coffee tables If it weren't for the popularity of tea, coffee tables would have never found their way into modern homes. At the height of the tea-drinking craze in Britain, a new low table where Brits could put their cups came into being. The tea table became the modern coffee table during the Arts and Crafts movement. Next time you play trivia you can thank designer E.W. Godwin for the fact that we don't have \"tea table books\" on our tea tables and can instead enjoy the low slung, versatile coffee table we've come to love today. Coffee Table tips: Since the very beginning of the Modernist movement, designers have been particularly drawn to the coffee table and end table as a place to experiment with new designs and materials. Here are some helpful tips so you can make the most of your coffee tables: - The Glass Coffee Table is a classic in modern furniture. Most glass coffee tables have tempered glass to prevent breakage and add strength. But if it's not specifically mentioned, be sure to ask. - When shopping for a round coffee table, square coffee table or oval coffee table, consider the furnishings that will surround it. Visually these are all grouped together and should complement one another. - If you like a piece that is as much a work of art as a coffee table or end table, consider a signature creation from one of the great modern designers such as van der Rohe, Gray or the Eames brothers. When it comes to coffee tables don't be shy about making a statement with the design. Modern furniture is not only functional, but fun as well.", " Modern Ottomans | Leather Ottoman | Fabric Ottoman | Foot Stool - Fire Collection": "1 View All Before the foot stool appeared in European homes in the early 1800s, who knows where people used to put their feet. Thankfully, the foot stool gained a foot hold in homes rapidly and morphed into the ottoman we know today. The modern ottoman and leather ottoman, along with fabric ottoman chairs, not only provide visitors and family members with an upholstered seat where they can rest their weary feet, but also offer additional seating during a party or holiday gathering. Also known as a tuffet (now you know what Little Miss Muffett was sitting on), the ottoman bench offers homeowners many choices in arranging the furnishings in their home. Whether they're placed at the end of a chair or recliner or in the center of a sofa grouping, this modern stool will add beauty and versatility to your living room furniture. One of the classic chair and ottoman sets is the Eames Lounge Chair and Ottoman. But be careful.

Several shades of appealing colors in modern and abstract designs bring a splash of newness to your home. The machine-woven technique offers durability, making it well suited for both low and high traffic areas. Woven of high quality polypropylene, this area rug will continue to look dazzling over the years. The soft feel of the fibers is incredibly comfortable underfoot and embraces a cozy home feeling. - Decorative modern & abstract design, ideal for any room - Machine woven with high quality polypropylene - Soft to the touch & comfortable medium pile height - Finishes your living space beautifully without overpowering - Ideal pile density to withstand foot traffic & easy to clean Care Instructions Regular care is essential to the longevity of your rug. Regular vacuuming is recommended without the use of beater bars to avoid threads being pulled. Spills should be absorbed with a dry cloth, then spot cleaned with mild soap and water. It\u2019s normal for loose ends to show up from time to time with any area rug, however it\u2019s important to snip them with a scissor immediately - pulling on loose ends by hand is harmful to the strength of your rug. Rug tolerances can vary by +/- 3 inches in relation to the advertised size. A non-skid pad is recommended to prevent slippage. Since rugs are rolled for shipping, occasionally they may crease during transit. All creases will disappear within 2 weeks after the rug is laid out flat. Reverse rolling will help flatten out creases promptly.

A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP The unique pressure relief and the warmth of the waterbed contribute to helping you achieve a deep and uninterrupted sleep, and they are two of the essential differences between waterbeds and traditional beds. UNIQUE PRESSURE RELIEFThe water mattress always adapts to your body, which prevents pressure points, and it supports you in any position. A waterbed always provides optimal body support, which is why we call it the best sleep in the world. The water mattress never changes its shape but provides the same comfort year after year. TEMPERED WARMTHA waterbed has a comfortable temperature all year. The warmth makes you relax and fall asleep faster during the winter, because you don't have to use energy warming up the bed first. The waterbed never gets too warm during summer either, because the temperature is adjusted with a thermostat. TAILOR-MADE FOR YOU Two water mattresses in your bed enable you and your partner to have different levels of stabilisation, lumbar support, and even different temperature settings. A divider between the water mattresses reduces the transmission of movements from one mattress to the other and enables you to sleep uninterrupted when your partner turns in bed. 13 LEVELS OF STABILISATION Akva Waterbeds offers 13 different levels of stabilisation. The stabilisation fibres diminish the motions in the water mattress and make the water mattress feel firmer. Furthermore, you can choose lumbar support which provides extra support and comfort in the lumbar region. ALLERGY-FRIENDLY SLEEPING ENVIRONMENTWaterbeds offer exceptional hygiene. The top cover can be removed and washed at 60\u00b0 C. The water mattress can be wiped off, kept clean and free from dust mites and allergens. This is a huge advantage if you have allergies. PHTHALATE FREE VINYLThe water mattresses from Akva Waterbeds are made of phthalate free vinyl which is also OEKO-TEX 100 certified and tested to ensure that it is free of any harmful substances. Our water mattresses are softened with the phthalate free and environmentally friendly softener Mesamoll II. OEKO-TEX STANDARD 100 All our vinyl and textiles are certified according to the highest standards and are accordingly approved for babies. Our waterbeds are equipped with allergy-friendly covers which can be removed and washed, and our textiles and vinyl live up to the requirements of OEKO-TEX standard 100 and are tested for harmful substances.", "Dunlopillo Vernay Winged 180cm Headboard": "Fair Price Delivery Local delivery \u00a330 / UK \u00a375 per order / Hot Tubs To Be Confirmed Buy Dunlopillo Vernay Winged 180cm Headboard Online With George Street Furnishers Cardiff & Newport Get a complete peace of mind with the most cost effective and comprehensive furniture protection scheme.

With Spoke Sofa, TAKT and Anderssen & Voll, have taken the typology of the sofa and pared it back to first principles, ensuring it is structurally transparent, entirely demountable and made from the most sustainable materials viable today.

By meticulously focusing on the many small details, we aim to achieve genuine, meaningful sustainability and circularity. Whereas removing and cleaning upholstery can be difficult or impossible with most conventional sofas, a significant part of the product-development process was spent ensuring that all the sofa\u2019s textiles were easy to remove for cleaning or replacement, facilitating maintenance and extending its lifespan. By meticulously focusing on the many small details, we aim to achieve genuine, meaningful sustainability and circularity. Low waste Available in EU-grown beech or oak, Spoke Sofa comes with 100% recycled Cyber or 98% recycled Cura upholstery in seven colours by Danish textile brand Gabriel. Traditional sofa padding is a composite of multiple materials to provide the right comfort and shape, which makes it impossible to recycle. Cushions in Spoke Sofa, however, are custom designed, recyclable mono-material foam, providing superior comfort and longevity. Our Perpetual Sustainable Design philosophy ensures that all our furniture is designed for repair so that you can replace or recycle components later in life. Make it yours Spoke Sofa can also be customised with a variety of Gabriel fabrics, ensuring that your sofa seamlessly blends in with your personal interior style.

Comfortable functionality With Spoke Sofa, comfort and functionality go hand in hand, creating the perfect seating experience. This sofa excels in both aspects, particularly in terms of firmness. While other sofas may lose their plumpness and support over time, the cushions of a Spoke Sofa remain resilient and firm. This remarkable feature ensures that your seating experience remains consistently comfortable, regardless of how frequently you indulge in moments of relaxation. In addition to the exceptional cushioning, Spoke Sofas also offer movable armrests. This added functionality allows you to tailor your seating position to your liking.

There is no such thing as a broken chair. TAKT\u2019s flat-pack plywood chairs and tables and upholstered sofas are simply assembled and knocked down, and made from components of sufficient quality to survive multiple reassemblies. Conceived as a fresh take on flat-pack, TAKT furniture is designed to empower buyers with a satisfying assembly experience and easy access to components. Climate Footprint Spoke Sofa Sustainability Spoke Sofa is made entirely of mono-materials, which allow for easy recycling at end of life. Most sofas are made of non-recyclable composite materials. Like all TAKT products, the sofa is designed with TAKT\u2019s Eco System Design principles and shipped as separate components in flat boxes. Spoke Sofa has secured the EU Ecolabel, like all TAKT products, confirming that every stage in the process has minimal impact on the environment. Spoke Sofa is designed for repair with replacement parts stocked so that its furniture could be handed down to future generations.

Our products are FSC-certified, which ensures the wood is from forests that are given time to naturally regenerate, sustain local wildlife and guarantee worker conditions. The surfaces are treated with naturall white-pigmented oil, pure oil or water based lacquer.

This treatment allows the wood to develop a characterful patina over time, and will also enable you to easily repair damage to the surface by applying light sandpaper and a new oil treatment \u2013 again and again. All of our products are FSC-certified. FSC-certified forrests are given time to naturally regenerate, local wildlife is sustained and worker conditions are balanced. The design is clean and simple, yet with a sculptural expression. The chair frame is made of metal tubes combined with a unique saddle connection to ensure a smooth transition where the hard metal meets the softer wood.Depping & J\u00f8rgensen", "Soft Lounge Chair | Beautiful and enduring sustainable furniture | TAKT": "Bringing new levels of comfort Soft Lounge Chair Leather brings new levels of comfort and warmth to the award winning product by Thomas Bentzen.

"https://woodshopfogoisland.ca/products/bertha-chair": {" Bertha Chair \u2013 Fogo Island Workshops ": "Solid. A dependable character of the highest sorts, the namesake of the Bertha chair is Bertha Wilson. The name came out of a conversation that the designer, Donna Wilson, had with Zita Cobb, founder of our parent charity, Shorefast. \u201cWhen she found out that I was Scottish and my last name was Wilson, she shared a story about the only other Scottish woman whom she had ever met who went by the name of Wilson \u2013 Bertha Wilson. A woman of modest means, she became the first female appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada. It seemed like a fitting name for such a humble and modern chair.\u201d The Bertha Chair is inspired by the vintage barrel chairs that were constructed from unused flour barrels. These chairs embody the outport attitude of finding new life for discarded or unused materials. Pair the Bertha Chair with a Pouffe to kick back and enjoy the view. Made using regionally sourced birch by our craftspeople at Fogo Island Workshops. Available in a range of finishes including hand-buffed Danish Oil, which deepens the amber colour of the wood, and White Oil, which neutralizes the amber tone for a raw matte look. Both absorb into the wood and richen the grain. A variety of coloured lacquers are available. Custom colours and sizing are available on request. The cushions and matching pouffe can be upholstered in either Kvadrat Divina upholstery or the iconic Shingle-Shangle pattern, inspired by the hand-carved shingles on historic Brett House in Joe Batt\u2019s Arm. Both are 100% wool that is ethically and sustainably sourced, naturally stain resistant, and comes with life-long durability rating of 45,000 Martindale rub tests.

Japanese designer Wataru Kumano has a new interpretation of the outport Newfoundland aesthetic with the Pins series. The Pins Table has a sturdy top surface matched with a playful and off-kilter base that mirrors the unsteady legs of the walking stilts used in play by Fogo Island children, as showcased in the National Film Board's Fogo Process films. Completely contemporary at the same time as being of the past, the collection presents an appreciation of the \u2018super normal\u2019 with quiet aesthetics that prioritize utility and tranquility desirable in modern life.

A Fogo Islander commented \u201cWe didn\u2019t have much but enough was enough.\u201d The small salt box houses of Outport Newfoundland were tight on space but big on creating a welcoming and social home with space that brought people close together. The kitchen was the heart of that home with friends and family coming in and out from dawn to dusk with no warning or pretense. The Kitchen Table, Chair, Bench and Stool by Swiss designer Anthony Guex has human-scaled proportions and fit into an urban loft as easily as a salt box house. Completely contemporary at the same time as being of the past, the collection presents an appreciation of the \u2018super normal\u2019 with quiet aesthetics that prioritize utility and tranquility desirable in modern urban life. Connecting past to present to future, these pieces express the value of the permanent over the disposable; they are made to be trusted and treasured. An enduring essential, the Kitchen Stool is perfectly proportioned and sensibly designed. The handle cut-out is an important detail that provides a simple solution for the demands of a busy household. It makes the piece easy to pick up, reconfigure, and tuck away, as required. Made using ethically grown and regionally sourced birch by our craftspeople in the Fogo Island Woodshop. Available in a range of finishes including hand-rubbed Danish Oil which creates an amber rich depth and White Oil which neutralizes the amber tone for a raw matte look.

The long variety could serve in a corridor, in an art gallery, in an event space as the ones built for the Fogo Island Inn do. The short little sibling could stand by the front door, at the base of a bed, or on the Porch. The Porch is the Outport Newfoundland name for the space at the back of the house you might call a mudroom.

The majority of our larger furniture items are delivered directly from our amazing brand partners. We work very closely with them to understand stock availability, but we also don\u2019t like to disappoint our customers if it is out of stock or if there is a lead time as stock levels change frequently. Therefore if an item has a \"lead times may apply' message this means they may be in stock or have a lead time of 4 - 12 weeks, it just means we need to double check stock availability as they are super popular. Feel free however to place an order now as we also guarantee a full refund (within the week of purchase), if we contact you to advise the item is out of stock and/or lead times are longer than expected.

A bed is also not something you purchase all the time, it is an investment, so you want to get it right! Choose the right bed online and you will sleep like a baby every night! So choosing the right bed online or bed head online all depends on whether the bed is going to be the feature of your bedroom or whether it is to blend in with your chosen style. Our coastal style beds by Uniqwa are a feature bed! You need to have the room for one of these, but it will look amazing in your bedroom. It is the perfect bed online for the coastal style or boho room! Our Eden rose gold beds are also a customer favourite with the kids. Especially with the wrought iron look these blend in well to most kids interior styles. Also our boucle bed head collection is super popular for anyone styling a coastal retreat. Beds are also a place where you like to have a cuppa in bed, read a book or just chill out so choosing a bed with an upholstered bedhead provides a little more comfort, but a timber frame does provide warmth to a room. We have a selection of bedheads online varying in size, shape and colour! Our boucle bed head is super popular too, selling out prior to shipments arriving alot of the time, so a pre-order is recommended. Actually all of the beds online at Cranmore Home & Co are usually pre-order as they are super popular, but it doesn't mean you usually have to wait too long, it just means you will definitely get one on the next available shipment.

(Metro only) Bedside tables are both practical and beautiful when it comes to adding style to your bedroom. They can even become the room\u2019s feature piece and upstage your bed frame. When picking bedside tables you need to consider a few things. Firstly, do they match your current bed frame or the bed frame you are planning on getting? It\u2019s important to get this right so your room doesn\u2019t end up looking mismatched. Much like interior designers, you must select similar style furniture to make sure everything fits. The second thing you need to consider is how much practicality you want your bedside tables to have. If you are looking for something minimalist then a stool-inspired bedside table is the way to go. Uniqwa has a wide selection of such bedside tables you can choose from. But if you are looking for something more practical, consider a locker bedside table. They have a lot of storage space and are suitable for a modern industrial-style home. Mustard Made is the leading brand when it comes to locker bedside tables, and their furniture comes in an array of different colours, so you can pick the one that best suits your bedroom.

(Metro only) Finding the right bar stool for your home can be easy or a little tricky! Especially if you are looking for bar stools online in Australia. I guess the key thing to think about is where are you placing these bar stools? In a bar area, under a kitchen bench or just as extra bar chair for your home? To ensure you select the right bar stool online make sure you get the sizing correct. Most bar chairs have two standard sizes - kitchen and bar, so make sure you measure the floor to surface height where you will be placing these stools. You should usually leave approx 30cm from the seat height of the bar stool to the underneath of the surface you are placing the stools near. The other key thing to consider when choosing bar stools online is whether you want a back or not for your bar stools. Are these being used for a long period of time? Then a back and soft seat might just be a must to provide that little extra bit of support. Our bar stools online below, provide a variety of options with many different materials - timber, leather, rattan and more. So how do you know which bar chair to choose if you don't already know? Look around the room that you are going to place your bar stools and see what other materials you already have in the room, and what is your style? You want complimentary materials. If however the bar stool is the key feature for the room, then why not go for stylish and practical bar stools! Go light oak timber legs for coastal style homes, with white seats or rattan. For a more contemporary look, try leather and timber and black seats - very classy! For a more rustic Farmhouse style why not go all timber? If you are looking for outdoor bar stools online, then make sure the materials used are suitable for the outdoors, whether undercover or exposed. Usually most outdoor bar stools online will provide information on whether a bar stool is suitable for outdoor use or not. Whatever your style we do hope our site provides the confidence for you to purchase your bar stools online at Cranmore Home & Co.

(Metro only) A sofa can make or break the living room and it\u2019s not always easy picking the right one. When choosing your sofa there are a couple of things you need to consider. Firstly, does it match your current living room furniture? Ideally, you would want to keep everything on theme. Look for a sofa or couch that matches your current coffee table, rug, tv stand and decor. The next step is deciding whether you want modular sofas and couches or just regular ones. The advantage of modular sofas and couches is that you can rearrange the modules to better fit your living room. This is ideal if you are a person that loves to rearrange their room every now and then. Regular sofas, on the other hand, cannot be rearranged, but usually make up for this with style. At Cranmore Home & Co. we offer a wide range of both regular and modular sofas and couches to suit any living room style.

These types of sofas are designed to be modular, meaning that they can be arranged in different configurations to suit a range of spaces and needs. This flexibility makes modular sofas and corner lounges ideal for small apartments, large homes, and everything in between. Modular couches and sofas are typically made up of individual sections that can be joined together to create a larger seating area. The sections can be arranged in various configurations, such as an L-shape, U-shape, or even a circular shape, depending on the space available and the desired look. Modular sofas can also be easily expanded or downsized by adding or removing sections as needed, making them a versatile option for any space. Corner lounges, on the other hand, are designed to fit snugly into a corner of a room, maximising the available space. They are typically L-shaped and can be left-handed or right-handed, depending on the layout of the room. Corner lounges are great for smaller spaces or open-plan living areas, as they allow for ample seating without taking up too much space. One of the benefits of modular sofas and corner lounges is their flexibility. They can be rearranged to suit different occasions, such as a movie night with friends or a family gathering. For example, a modular sofa can be arranged in a U-shape for a cozy conversation area, or in a long straight line for a more formal setting. Similarly, a corner lounge can be paired with a few armchairs from the same or different range and a coffee table to create a comfortable and functional living area. Another benefit of modular sofas and corner lounges is their ability to accommodate different lifestyles. For example, a family with young children might opt for a corner lounge with chaise, providing a comfortable and safe space for kids to play and relax. Alternatively, an older couple may opt for a 3 seater sofa that can have an ottoman attached to create a more formal living area to entertain guests. In addition to their flexibility, modular sofas and corner lounges also offer a range of design options. They come in a variety of styles, from Scandinavian to modern-contemporary and can be upholstered in a range of fabrics and colours. Overall, modular sofas and corner lounges are a great option for anyone looking for versatile and flexible seating solutions. With their ability to be arranged in various configurations, their ability to accommodate different lifestyles, and their range of design options, modular sofas and corner lounges are a stylish and functional addition to any home. RJ Living has a range of modular sofas and couches, such as the Jam, Seam, Swell, Ondo and Dumpling that are available to be purchased in a variety of fabrics and colours.", " Buy Glass Top Coffee Tables Online in Australia | RJ Living ": "Returns & RefundsRead more You are viewing out of products You may also like Muse 6 Drawer Chest - Oak Spend $2000 Save 15% Red Tulips Print Spend $500 Save 10% Renew Armchair - Corduroy Spend $500 Save 10% Groove Sideboard - Oak Spend $2000 Save 15% Boucle Stripe Cushion - Tan Peach Spend $500 Save 10% Gather Dining Table - 200cm Spend $2000 Save 15% Glass Coffee Tables Glass Coffee Tables You'll Love Add a striking statement piece to your home with a stunning glass-top coffee table.

When it comes to furniture pieces, the terms \"end table\" and \"side table\" are often used interchangeably. While they are similar in function, there are some slight differences between the two. Typically, an end table is placed at the end of a sofa or beside a chair, while a side table can be used in various locations throughout a room. End tables are often taller than side tables, and they may have a drawer or shelf for additional storage. Side tables, on the other hand, are usually smaller and more portable, making them perfect for holding drinks or snacks while entertaining. What can I use instead of a side table? If you are looking for an alternative to a traditional side table, there are several options to consider. One option is to use a small bookshelf or a set of nesting tables. You can also repurpose an old trunk or suitcase as a unique and stylish side table. Another option is to use a floor lamp with a built-in table, which can provide both lighting and a functional surface. Don't be afraid to get creative and think outside the box when it comes to finding the perfect side table alternative for your space. What are side tables in the living room called? In the living room, side tables are sometimes referred to as accent tables or occasional tables. They are designed to provide a functional surface for drinks, snacks, or decorative items, while also adding style and visual interest to the room. Side tables can come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials, making it easy to find one that complements your existing decor. How high should a side table be next to a sofa? The height of your side table can make a big difference in both the function and aesthetics of your space. As a general rule, your side table should be approximately the same height as the armrest of your sofa or chair. This will ensure that the table is easy to reach from a seated position and that it looks visually balanced next to your furniture. Keep in mind that the height of your sofa or chair arms may vary, so be sure to measure carefully before selecting your side table.", " 8 Seater Dining Tables | Australia Wide Delivery | RJ Living ": "Returns & RefundsRead more You are viewing out of products You may also like Muse 6 Drawer Chest - Oak Spend $2000 Save 15% Red Tulips Print Spend $500 Save 10% Renew Armchair - Corduroy Spend $500 Save 10% Groove Sideboard - Oak Spend $2000 Save 15% Boucle Stripe Cushion - Tan Peach Spend $500 Save 10% Gather Dining Table - 200cm Spend $2000 Save 15% 8 Seater Dining Tables Throw the most memorable get-togethers with the best 8-seater dining tables in Australia.

If you dream of a functional yet stylish dining room, dining chairs are the perfect accent pieces you\u2019re looking for. How To Buy Dining Chairs? Create an amazing mealtime experience by making sure that your dining chairs match the overall look of your dining space. - Take your pick from furniture pieces of different silhouettes, colours, and shapes! Get creative and match the style of your dining room to the interior design f your choosing. - Make sure that at least part of the chairs should match the colour of the dining table. You can go lighter or darker on either the seat or the frame, but having some of the chairs match the table creates a pleasing and holistic look for the room design. - Decide on upholstery if you\u2019d prefer the added comfort of an upholstered seat. How To Choose The Right Dining Chair Height? Regular dining tables are 30 inches high, and chairs should be 17-19 inches high to match. If your table is higher or lower, try to leave about 13 inches of space from the bottom of the table to the seat of the chair. You can go down to ten inches if necessary, but 13 is better. In order for the person sitting at the table to feel at ease, the seat base must be approximately 40-49 centimeters above the floor. How Do You Match Dining Tables and Chairs? Choosing a dining table should match the size of your room, as well as the number of people you want to host and how you like serving meals. Rectangle tables and oval tables are best for a big dining room, while square tables and circle tables work for smaller dining rooms. Tables and chairs can disrupt traffic if you put them in the wrong place. Try to keep them far enough away from walls and storage pieces to give enough space to walk around in.", " Bed Heads & Headboards Online in Australia | RJ Living ": "Returns & RefundsRead more You are viewing out of products You may also like Muse 6 Drawer Chest - Oak Spend $2000 Save 15% Red Tulips Print Spend $500 Save 10% Renew Armchair - Corduroy Spend $500 Save 10% Groove Sideboard - Oak Spend $2000 Save 15% Boucle Stripe Cushion - Tan Peach Spend $500 Save 10% Gather Dining Table - 200cm Spend $2000 Save 15% Bed Heads & Headboards Furnish your bedroom with stylish and modern bed heads in Australia.

What are the benefits of a dressing table? A dressing table provides a dedicated space for getting ready and can help to keep personal items organized and easily accessible. It can also be a decorative focal point in a bedroom or dressing room. Where should I place my dressing table? Your dressing table should be placed in a well-lit area of your room, ideally near a window or other source of natural light. It should also be easily accessible and situated near a power outlet if you plan to use electrical grooming tools or appliances. How do I care for my dressing table? To keep your dressing table in good condition, wipe it down regularly with a soft cloth or microfiber towel to remove dust and debris. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the finish. For wooden dressing tables, consider purchasing the same oil which was applied during the manufacturing process, so you can reapply about once a year. How do I style my dressing table? To style your dressing table, consider adding decorative accents such as a vase of fresh flowers, a decorative tray or jewellry box, and a few personal items such as photographs or favourite books. You can also experiment with different lighting options, such as a small table lamp or string lights, to create a cosy and inviting atmosphere.", " Outdoor Benches & Sofas | Garden Benches, Bench Seats & Cushions | RJ Living ": "Returns & RefundsRead more You are viewing out of products You may also like Muse 6 Drawer Chest - Oak Spend $2000 Save 15% Red Tulips Print Spend $500 Save 10% Renew Armchair - Corduroy Spend $500 Save 10% Groove Sideboard - Oak Spend $2000 Save 15% Boucle Stripe Cushion - Tan Peach Spend $500 Save 10% Gather Dining Table - 200cm Spend $2000 Save 15% Outdoor Benches Explore the best outdoor benches in Australia for your garden and patio.

These chairs are made partially from metal, and often have a sleek, minimalist design. They can be finished in a few varying colours and textures.

These chairs can be made from a variety of woods, such as solid European oak, solid American oak or teak and often have a simple, elegant design that compliments a wide range of dining tables. They can be finished in a variety of stains and can be crafted in a variety of shapes and sizes. They can also come with mesh, leather or plain wooden seat. Plastic chairs are also a popular choice for modern contemporary dining rooms. Made from moulded plastic, these chairs often have a modern, sculptural design. They are lightweight and easy to clean, making them a great choice for both indoor and outdoor dining areas. FAQs about Modern Contemporary Dining Chairs How do I choose the right size chair for my dining table? When choosing dining chairs, it's important to consider the size of your dining table. The chairs should be proportional to the table, so they don't look too small or too large. As a general rule, the seat height of the chair should be about 300 mm less than the height of the table. How do I care for my modern contemporary dining chairs? The care and maintenance of your dining chairs will depend on the material they are made from. For upholstered chairs, it's important to vacuum or brush the fabric regularly and clean any spills or stains immediately. Metal chairs can be wiped down with a damp cloth and mild soap, while wooden chairs should be dusted regularly and the surface re-oiled as needed. Plastic chairs can be cleaned with soap and water or a mild cleaning solution. It is best to check the Product Specifications on each product page of the website for more cleaning and maintenance tips. Are modern contemporary dining chairs comfortable? Yes, modern contemporary dining chairs can be very comfortable, especially those with upholstered seats and backrests. However, the level of comfort will depend on the specific design and materials used. It's always a good idea to try out chairs in person before purchasing to ensure they are comfortable for you and your guests."}, "https://shop-ames-interiors.com/products/gift-card": {"EGIFT CARD \u2013 Shop Ames Interiors": "Shopping for someone else but not sure what to give them?

First Name Last Name Email Password", " Furniture Care Instructions \u2013 Byron Bay Hanging Chairs ": "Furniture Care Instructions Teak: Handcrafted of solid teak Our teak is SVLK-certified by the Indonesian government, ensuring that it is sustainably grown and responsibly harvested from managed forests Weathered Teak is a handcrafted, multistep finish. If left uncovered, our Weathered Teak finish will wear away with exposure to the elements. Once the applied finish has worn off, the furniture will begin to acquire the beautiful silvery-grey patina that is typical of untreated teak. Teak wood is naturally durable and exceptionally resistant to the elements. Use a combination of mild soap and water, such as liquid dish-washing soap, to clean the surface of your teak furniture. Do not use any type of cleaner that contains harsh chemicals as this may damage the finish. Please use a coaster or trivet (if applicable) under hot or cold items to protect the finish of your coffee table/surfaces. If moisture touches a surface, wipe off immediately. Situate your table and/or chairs away from incoming direct sunlight, which can cause the wood to fade and crack. Keep your table away from other heat sources, such as radiators and fireplaces, that can also cause the wood to split or war. To use your teak furniture outdoors, they must be fully treated with a professional teak oil and sealer to avoid water marks and stains from weather. Rattan / Cane Please use a damp towel to spot clean surfaces. Do not use any type of cleaner that contains harsh chemicals as this may damage the finish. If your rattan starts to look dry, apply a small amount of linseed oil to nourish the rattan. Please be sure to use a coaster under hot or cold items to protect the finish. Rattan furniture should be stored in dry conditions as it is an organic material. Prolonged dampness can lead to mould, therefore we do not recommend using rattan furniture outside or left in the rain. Rattan Webbing is fitted whilst wet. It forms its strength when drying out. Humidity and rain may cause the rattan to loosen. Should the rattan webbing stay loose and look stretched, apply water and then allow to dry naturally in sunlight. Bamboo: Use a feather duster or a soft brush to sweep the dust off of your bamboo furniture. For a thorough clean, use a combination of mild soap and water, such as gentle liquid dish-washing soap, to clean the surface of your bamboo furniture, best applied through a spray bottle. Please then allow the bamboo to fully dry naturally. You can restore the bamboo shine by rubbing the piece periodically with linseed or other furniture oil specifically for bamboo. Do not use any type of cleaner that contains harsh chemicals as this may damage the finish. Please use a coaster under hot or cold items to protect the finish of your coffee table/surfaces. If moisture touches a surface, wipe off immediately. Cushion Covers: All of our cushions and fabric covers are for indoor use only and must not be left outside in multiple weather conditions. If spillages occur, plot dry immediately with a cloth. For tougher stains, please use a fabric detergent and wash by hand or on a delicate cycle, using cold water only. Allow to dry naturally, Do not", " About us \u2013 Byron Bay Hanging Chairs ": "About us Byron Bay Hanging Chairs was established in 2013 by interior enthusiast and now style entrepreneur, Leanne Dunnings. Starting small, Leanne began her journey by importing small quantities of the ever famous rattan hanging chair for her friends and family who resonated with her coastal luxe style and who admired her eye for detail in design. BBHC soon became an online haven of all things bamboo and rattan paying tribute to 70\u2019s style interior, all whilst bringing a certain Byron Bay finish to add a contemporary feel to the BBHC signature style. 8 Years on and Leanne now oversees a high in demand online store, local warehouse, overseas production team & retail showroom situated in the heart of Byron Bay. \u201cOver the years, I have learnt to carefully select and design pieces which I believe have purpose in a home, one that makes the product useful or that maximises comfort but aesthetically harmonises with the space and concept. Well made and reasonable in value. As a team, we are always aiming to be innovative with our brand but its important we don't lose that homely feel, one that our customers can relate too and visualise in their own homes.\u201d The collections you browse today are collaborated designs by Leanne and our talented team of Artisans based in Indonesia. Produced by sustainable materials such as rattan, bamboo and cane, we sourced these from local farming communities, an important ethos for us here at BBHC. All the products we sell are inspired from past and present trends and made by hand, giving each piece its own character and unique detailing.

We are passionate about creating a positive future for the communities and artisans who hand craft our unique pieces. Their craftsmanship and talented skills are a staple part of the Byron bay hanging chairs brand and ensuring they are working in a safe environment is paramount to us. Our artisans are employed by a small, independent production company, based in Indonesia, where they are supported by fair trade practices. This was an important element for Byron Bay Hanging Chairs when choosing how the production of our collections would be managed. As our business grows, so does our production team and the opportunities within, creating employment prospects, bettering lifestyle\u2019s and helping to grow the economy for the benefit of local communities and their families. Sustainability Rattan & Bamboo Rattan and bamboo is a fast growing and renewable palm that has multiple uses and requires no pesticides or fertilisers. In forests where rattan grows, its economic value can help protect forest land, by providing an alternative to loggers who forgo timber logging and harvest rattan cane instead. Rattan and bamboo are much easier to harvest as they essentially only need sunlight and water to grow. Both of these materials can continue to grow in extreme levels of moisture and dryness. It will also grow in steeply soiled land whereas timber would not be supported in such conditions. Both are much lighter in weight for transport, meaning it has a lower carbon footprint compared to metals and other timbers. They require simpler tools - meaning they don't require heavy duty machinery that would ordinarily burn fossil fuels to operate. Using Rattan and Bamboo that doesn't use such machinery reduces pollution to the environment as it can be transported by hand or by simpler carts that can be drawn by animals, not to mention, it grows much faster than most tropical wood. The benefit of this is that it is much kinder to the soil, contributing to preventing soil erosion as it holds moisture in the soil enhancing the soil instead of depleting it. This means the soil stays healthy for continuous growth. Bamboo is a self-regenerating material, meaning when you cut one pole down, another grows in its place, these new shoots grow within a couple of months. As a fast growing industry, rattan and bamboo farming is heavily relied on for the growth of economies all around the world. We are proud to produce collections based from bamboo, it is carbon neutral and produces 35% more oxygen than the equivalent stand of trees, contributing greatly to the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Teak Where our products promote the use of teak and reclaimed woods, our supplier and production partners must now hold a valid license and certification to be able to work with such timbers. Where possible we dictate that products should be produced using reclaimed woods. This is something that we are conscious of and we limit the quantity of timber usage across our collections. Packaging Whilst we import our furniture from overseas, most, if not all of our products are checked and packed in our local warehouse here in Australia. Whilst we do not claim to be perfect, we are proud to be environmentally conscious, meaning we use minimal plastic in our packaging where possible. At least 90% of our packaging materials are card and cardboard offering protection against damages but easily recyclable for our warehouse team and our customer", " Returns \u2013 Byron Bay Hanging Chairs ": "Returns We offer a 7 day return policy on all of our chairs from the date you receive your item.

Pony has a moulded foam body, feet and ears which are all connected by a tube frame and upholstered in a stretch fabric. Pony chair was designed in 1973 by Eero Aarnio. We are happy to provide you fabric samples to help you decide the perfect colour for your Pony. You can find our contact information here. Dimensions: 110 cm width x 65 cm depth x 87 cm height Materials: Metal, moulded foam, fabric Weight: 5.0 kg \u201cA chair is a chair, is a chair, is a chair... but a seat does not necessarily have to be a chair. It can be anything as long as it is ergonomically correct. A seat could even be a small and soft Pony on which you can ride or sit sideways. Pony looks like a child\u2019s oversized toy, but its dimensions are suited to adults. We are all big kids, of course.\u201d In 1972 the Aarnios lived in Tontunm\u00e4ki, where Eero utilized their garage as his work space. Although his previous pieces had already possessed uniqueness and characteristics, Eero describes Pony as his first very unusual design. He thought about chairs. One can sit almost anywhere. A seat doesn\u2019t even have to be a chair or a sofa. One can sit on the stairs, on a rock, on a tree stump, on a horse, on a pony\u2026 He decided to design a soft animal figure, which you could sit on, like riding a horse. In 1973 the first sketch of the Pony was sent to Asko Furniture company, who was the main producer of Eero Aarnio\u2019s designs. They completed the basic form for the seat and sent it by bus to Puumala, where Eero continued developing the prototype at the Aarnio family\u2019s summer cottage. Eero thought the first mold was decent but needed enhancing. In the country side, there was plenty of space to work, and since the body was made of polystyrene, he didn\u2019t mind getting his hands and surroundings all over it. Eero bought some modeling clay and worked further with the body. After the basic form was finished, he painted the first Pony white. From the start Eero knew the Pony needed upholstering. The process for the upholsterer is extremely challenging and difficult, requiring rare talent in hand crafting. As a result, one can only admire the magnificent seaming, intertwining together with the form of the body and flexibility of the fabric. However, some Ponys out there do not have their \u2018furs\u2019. Batches has been produced of concrete to serve as road blocks. Ponys made of concrete are not easily moved around, since they weigh as much as 250kg. Eero Aarnio\u2019s Pony is no regular chair. The designer himself prefers to rather call it a seat. Eero designed the Pony first and foremost to provide a comfortable form. The size came out of ergonomics, it is the perfect height for back and feet to rest. One can ride it or sit sideways on it. Eero initially designed the smaller size for children, however, the young have always been as keen on to climb on the larger Pony. It looks like a child\u2019s oversized toy, even though the dimensions are designed for adults. \u201cWe are all big kids, of course\u201d, says Eero Aarnio. Pony is often referred to as intriguing the inner child in adults. Eero\u2019s design aesthetics have a certain playfulness and humor, which have been very salient in his creativity and thinking process. Eero believes certain pieces should have a certain personality, one that suits them perfectly. For example, color is a key part of the message and a way of communicating for Eero. For the Pony, Eero prefers the colors green and white. Although, speaking from experience, for a family with children, white can be quite sensitive\u2026"}, "https://midcenturymasters.com/products/sculptural-ebonized-credenza-with-silver-leafed-front": {"Sculptural Ebonized Credenza with Silver Leafed Front \u2013 MidCentury Masters": "This nine drawer credenza has had a total ground up restoration with the case being ebonized in a rich black and the drawer fronts silver leafed.

For information on the previous deprecation of Google+ for users with personal Google accounts, please see this post . What's Changing We are nearing the end of this transition. Beginning July 5, 2023, Currents will no longer be available. Workspace administrators can export Currents data using Takeout before August 8, 2023. Beginning August 8th, Currents data will no longer be available for download. Although we are saying goodbye to Currents, we continue to invest in new features for Google Chat , so teams can connect and collaborate with a shared sense of belonging. Over the last year, we've delivered features designed to support community engagement at scale, and will continue to deliver more. Here is a summary of the features with additional details below: This month, we\u2019re enabling new ways for organizations to share information across the enterprise with announcements in Google Chat . This gives admin controls to limit permissions for posting in a space, while enabling all members to read and react, helping ensure that important updates stay visible and relevant. Later this year, we plan to simplify membership management by integrating Google Groups with spaces in Chat, enable post-level metrics for announcements, and provide tools for Workspace administrators to manage spaces across their domain. Announcements in Google Chat Managing space membership with Google Groups We\u2019ve already rolled out new ways to make conversations more expressive and engaging such as in-line threading to enable rich exploration of a specific topic without overtaking the main conversation and custom emojis to enable fun, personal expression. In-line threaded conversations Discover and join communities with up to 8,000 members We\u2019ve also made it easier for individuals to discover and join communities of shared interest . By searching in Gmail , users can explore a directory of available spaces covering topics of personal or professional interest such as gardening, pets, career development, fitness, cultural identity, and more, with the ability to invite others to join via link. Last year, we increased the size of communities supported by spaces in Chat to 8,000 members , and we are working to scale this in a meaningful way later this year. A directory of spaces in Google Chat for users to join. Our partner community is extending the power of Chat through integrations with essential third-party apps such as Jira, GitHub, Asana, PagerDuty , Zendesk and Salesforce . Many organizations have built custom workflow apps using low-code and no-code tools , and we anticipate that this number will continue to grow with the GA releases of the Chat API and AppSheet\u2019s Chat app building capabilities later this year. For teams to thrive in this rapidly changing era of hybrid work, it\u2019s essential to build authentic personal connections and a strong sense of belonging, no matter when or where individuals work. We will continue to make Google Chat the best option for Workspace customers seeking to build a community and culture for hybrid teams, with much more to come later this year. Who's impacted Admins and end users Why it\u2019s important The transition from Currents to spaces in Google Chat removes a separate, siloed destination and provides organizations with a modern, enterprise-grade experience that reflects how the world is working today. Google Workspace customers use Google Chat to communicate about projects, share organizational updates, and build community. Recommended action Availability Spaces in Google Chat are available to all Google Workspace customers and users with personal Google Accounts.
