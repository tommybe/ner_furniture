Originally conceived by Swedish based South Korean designer Jay Design in 2012, this beautiful ethereal piece seems to defy the law of gravity. The Chieut has attracted the praise of leading architectural luminaries such as the Zaha Hadid Architects and was the recipient of the prestigious Golden A' Design Award in 2017. The Chieut table is entirely handcrafted in Italy by design atelier Minimaproject with the finest materials in a limited edition of 200 pieces to guarantee the uniqueness of each piece. Both body and legs can be ordered in a number of powder coating colour finishes to obtain interesting cromatic combinations. Small imperfections might be present-evidence that our pieces are unique and not mass produced.

This will be automatically calculated at checkout for Northern Ireland. Please call or send us a message here if you want to discuss delivery options to your postcode.

We supply all bolts and tools needed and it only takes a few minutes. We can also arrange assembly and removal of packaging using a white glove service that will do all the heavy lifting for you. This usually costs \u00a335. Please remember to provide a contact telephone number at checkout. All couriers require this and without it, we can't send your furniture!
