Please create a seperate order for each pre-order product type. We just need a 20% deposit to secure your items.\nNote: This is a frame only. Does not come with mattress or cover. Mattress and cover can be purchased separately.\nA Vast Icon, the Samson Daybed is a simple design, beautifully executed.\nCrafted from solid mango hardwood, and hand finished with 4 coats of hard wearing NC lacquer, this daybed is designed to last for decades. While we sell many of these for inside use, it is also perfectly suited for a covered veranda.\nThe timber used in this piece is sustainably sourced Mango Wood. Each plank is individually treated in a computer controlled kiln to reduce the chance of any cracks or warping in its long future as a furniture component.\nThis piece has been handcrafted by one of our Vast Masters, these individual cabinet makers have been manufacturing Vast products for over a decade. Using traditional joinery techniques to maximise the timber's natural beauty is a big part of the unique look of each Vast product. We call this \"working with the grain\". After the joinery is complete it is then hand sanded and hand polished with several coats of high grade German lacquer so it will last for generations!\nCountry of Origin: India\nHardwood is a natural material which reacts to its environment and although our manufacturing process allows for normal expansion and contraction, extreme high or low humidity may cause more swelling than normal. To minimise movement and ensure longevity of your purchase we recommend taking good care of your piece as outlined below:\n- Dust regularly with a clean cotton cloth;\n- Use tablecloths, table runners and coasters to help prevent scratches to the surface and wipe up any spills immediately;\n- To nourish and protect your furniture we recommend waxing with a natural beeswax every 6-12 months.\n- Only use natural wax, oil or water based cleaning products. Do not use solvent based cleaning products that may contain silicone or alcohol, as this may react and permanently damage the lacquer.\n- Do not expose to fragrant oils, insect repellent lotion, or nail polish remover as these are often solvent based and will damage the lacquer\n- Avoid placing your furniture near fireplaces, in direct sunlight or under heating/cooling vents.\n- Do not leave hot items or ice cold items directly on the surface of the table as water marking may occur.\n- Any metal work featuring on your product has been powder coated. Any damage to the surface should be contained as soon as possible to prevent rusting.\nProduct Specs\nBox 1 (top) 220 x 90 x 13cm.

For us to send the gift card directly to your recipient with a personal note, please add the email address and personal note at check out in the \"note for order\" section.\nAny questions please contact us.\nLead Times May Apply - Stock Availability:\nAs we are an online only store we hold our homewares and smaller furniture items at our warehouse in Perth. The majority of our larger furniture items are delivered directly from our amazing brand partners. We work very closely with them to understand stock availability, but we also don\u2019t like to disappoint our customers if it is out of stock or if there is a lead time as stock levels change frequently. Therefore if an item has a \"lead times may apply' message this means they may be in stock or have a lead time of 4 - 12 weeks, it just means we need to double check stock availability as they are super popular. Feel free however to place an order now as we also guarantee a full refund (within the week of purchase), if we contact you to advise the item is out of stock and/or lead times are longer than expected.\nPre-Orders:\nWe do however highly recommend placing a pre-order as items can sell out prior to shipments arriving, and this will ensure you receive your piece in the next shipment. If you would like estimated lead times, shipping quotes or any other information please try the instant chat or click on the Get In Touch button and we will get back to you as soon as possible. We can arrange a 50% deposit for all pre-order items, with balance due prior to delivery.\nLead Times:\nCranmore Home & Co quote an approximate lead time for the receipt of any orders based on information provided by their partner suppliers at time of purchase. Circumstances beyond our control, may cause disruptions and lead to a delay in your order being delivered on quoted lead times once an order is placed. We will keep you as up to date as possible on any changes to estimated lead times.\nDelivery:\nWhat we can promise is that we will ship all in-stock products from our Perth warehouse within 3 business days and in the case of bespoke or out-of-stock products, customers will be emailed as soon as possible with an estimated shipping date. As we are an online business and many of our larger items are delivered directly from our suppliers, in this case we endeavour to ensure that our suppliers dispatch in-stock items within 5-10 business days. Delivery all depends on where it is coming from and where you live. We generally allow 7-14 days most metro areas and for many country locations, WA, NT & Tasmania please allow 2-3 weeks. Some of our items are available for collection from our Perth warehouse and will have this information on the product page if available.\nNOTE: For pre-orders from suppliers with stock coming from international manufacturers please keep in mind, the current worldwide increase in demand and restrictions for international ocean freight container exports. This is affecting supply chains extensively and sometimes lead time extensions are out of our control.\nShipping:\nAll items have a flat fee based on weight, dimensions and delivery location. This cost ranges from $9.95 - $250 for metro areas throughout Australia and this will be applied at checkout if required. For regional areas throughout Australia or for some super heavy/bulky/fragile items you may incur an additional fee, this will be advised after checkout, prior to dispatch if required. If you would like a quote tailored for your order prior to check out please contact us . Some of our items are available for collection from our Perth warehouse and will have this information on the product page if available. Orders over $2500 are eligible for free shipping to metro cities (exc TAS & NT). For all orders over $2500 that fall within regional postcodes they will incur an additional delivery charge invoiced after order. Please contact us for a quote prior to order if you would like this confirmed.\nPLEASE NOTE: Delivery is to your post box or front door only.
